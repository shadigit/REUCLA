I am holding on to it. someone swims out to save me because he thinks I will drownsink by holding on to the car. but we just float along car and I and suddenly the car turns into a blue towel small. It is like one of those sponges that shrink down when not in use. Then I and towel land on shore. There is a little boy there. about age 4. who is delighted to see that when we put towel on the sand, it slowly grows back into a big blue car. like magic! Before this, some people were asking me about how much Gaetha's husband makes e. g. Harold. people from the Wakefield, R. I. town council voting. and I told them he's a professor at a college but that he makes most of his money from mgmnt. consulting. They looked very skeptical as if he made too much. Then I was with the Dynamy kids in their apartment and we were working on a project. and you needed paper with typed lines on it for the project. and one of the girls ruined the piece that she had. so I went upstairs to guys' apartment to get more. The guy who lived up there was really cute. But Ahron was also up there, and Sarit his wife were there and other women. He pulled me over to him. we could both feel the electricity. that I am very attracted to him and him to me, and I could feel that he wanted me. He whispered something to the other people. like to go away because he wanted to be with me. He had me sit down on his lap and he started to caress me. I wanted him! Then I woke up by the alarm in real life. Before that, there was a scene where I was at a party at Ahron's house. he lived in a big mansion with his wife Sarit. And Sarit was named Tova and she was really pretty once in a while she looked like Simona, Ezra's wife in Israel and she was really nice to me. So that later, I felt really guilty about being with her boyfriend Ahron. Also earlier. I located some old cocaine. very old, in magazine. paper envelope. and I wanted to turn Ahron onto it. But I was not sure if it was ok to do it up since it was extremely old.\n",

      "I was responsible for taking care of a little blonde. haired blue. eyed boy. aged 2. and I was in an apartment with 2 men. young men. I was supposed to be watching the boy. But one of the men was supposed to be watching him for the moment. And the little boy wandered out and into the street. it was between 5 and 6 P. M. and there was rush. hour traffic. just like 3 lanes of massive traffic, cars indeciph. cutting each other off, etc. And the little boy was just walking through the traffic and I was terrified that he was gona get hit. I ran out the front door and started running through the traffic. The boy was ahead of me. The boy was walking through the traffic aimlessly, unknowingly, and I was running afterwards, dodging in and out of the cars. And I was dodging in and out of the cars and just running. it was risking my life. I kept just missing getting hit by cars. and I lost sight of the boy. so I was just chasing blindly or by instinct. and all I could think was that I had to get him. it did not matter if this was really dangerous. I thought I should be risking my life 100 and not thinking at all about myself but I did hesitate a few times and looked at the traffic, trying not to get killed. Finally the 2. year. old little boy indeciph. a side street and I ran straight ahead. Someone. I think it was a young woman. found him, picked him up, and brought him to me. I was the one that the boy loved. and needed. and the woman who found him knew this. So she handed him to me and I held him. And I was a little afraid that the boy would be angry, or not want me anymore but he was okay. Rae was the mother and I'd been babysitting for her son. And when I saw her again back at the house, she was mad that I'd let him walk out into the street. but not as mad as I'd expected her to be. and I explained that it happened while the man was supposed to be watching. And I did not want to have to give the son back to her. The two men. one I think was David Steinor a blonde. haired, blue. eyed German. descent Jew that I work with and the other was similar to the guy who cooked dinner for me at Kirby's house last night, who also had dirty. blonde hair and beard and mustache. I was thinking, and so was Rae, about the long. term effect that this incident would have on the boy. like whether he would get panicked whenever he crossed a bridge I guess there was a bridge scene somewhere there or whenever he was in traffic, whether he would be generally afraid and not trusting about life, etc.\n",

      "I was sitting someplace like a lobby. There was a baby in a carriage laying down in front of me, that was supposed to be a newborn baby. She looked like the baby Nicole who in real life died recently at about aged 2 from a liver transplant. I went to breast. feed her and I could feel her biting and chewing my nipple and I did not like the way it felt. it kind of hurt or felt uncomfortable. It was my left breast. I had a scar down my center that was sore, like a cut; it hurt, but was not excessively sore. There was a staircase ahead and to my left. Someone pointed out to me that the baby was too big for a newborn baby. Somehow I learned that the baby had been born 6 months ago in May apparently this was November now and I had a case of amnesia since going into the hospital to give birth. I had gone in to have the baby. The hospital looked like the one I was in in real life when I went to have surgery a few years ago to see why I'd been having bad menstrual cramps to see if maybe I had endometriosis; and apparently my mother told them to give me a Caesarian; without consulting me or telling me, they injected something into me and I fell asleep so they could perform the Caesarian. And from that moment on I stayed amnesiac until that moment 6 months later with the baby, when I woke up or came out of it. I looked at the baby and was trying to think of what to call her when I'd still thought she was new. born. She was blonde. I first thought of calling her Carrie, then I thought of calling her Jacaranda. But then I thought that if her name was Jacaranda her Hebrew name would be Yakova and that was an old. fashioned name. This was about one month before Christmastime. And my mother said do not be silly, of course she'd already chosen a name when the baby had first been born; this was 6 months later. It was Elizabeth. The baby's name was Elizabeth. And I felt deeply hurt that my mother had chosen the name for my baby; I felt intruded on. I said I was going to change the name. My mother and father and other relatives were furious and offended. In a later scene I was at a gathering. My father as a young man was there and also my mother. My father's presence in the dream, at this gathering, was very strong. I asked myself something about having to think of a name for the baby now i. e. now that I knew she was already 6 months old. I felt that since I had not been there when the baby was born, I had not formed a bond with the baby, that it was better if I just left this baby since I could not care for her, and let my mother raise her. The people at this gathering were outraged at this idea. Their attitude was she's my baby and I must learn how, regardless of what happened before. Indeciph. got that way and indeciph. walked out of the party. I felt I could not love her, that she belonged to my mother. I said something like that the next two babies I'd have would probably be boys, with my luck, and I'd always wanted a girl. But I just could not keep this girl. I also remarked on the fact that now, every other birth I would have would have to be a Caesarian, although in the back of my mind I did recall having read that sometimes a woman who'd had a Caesarian could still have a normal birth. In a later scene I tracked down Gloria; she was living in Mattapan, in Roxbury. I also went to live there and it turned out I was living right across the street from Gloria. I was trying to call her on the phone and she saw me through the window and asked me to come over. She was lying in the bed of a place with several beds, almost like a dormitory. style hostel, a small hostel. One of the beds was occupied by a wise man, a guru; he looked like Rajneesh. He gave her some advice regarding me. I think it was do not get together with her until she goes back to her baby. I wanted to get Gloria under my wing but she was not willing anymore, due to the advice she'd gotten. But she did still care; she just was not willing to let me pretend to be like a parent to her anymore. In the scene with Gloria, I had very much wanted her approval; I wanted her to look up to me the way she used to. But the approval was not forthcoming. In another scene I was in another house in the neighborhood in Mattapan and across the street was my cousin Marjie Saltiel. I could see her house through some sliding glass doors. I was watching a movie on my TV, and she was watching a movie on her TV; it was a continuing saga, and at one point, through the sliding glass doors, I asked her if she wanted to watch the final episode at my place. In another scene, I had something in the trunk of my car that belonged to Marjie; I thinik it was a piece from a baby carriage; and somehow I was not supposed to have it. It signified something about my having left my baby. Marjie disapproved of what I had done. leaving my baby. In the scene watching TV in the house, Marjie did come over to watch the last episode at my place. I was very angry and righteous towards my mother for having gotten me into this in the first pace. A part of me did love the baby and she was very cute, although she alternated between looking like the cute Nicole on TV and looking like the sick, ugly Nicole. I wanted to love the baby but something was preventing me, stopping me; I felt like it was the anger and resentment at my mother. And the fact that I'd already missed so much of the necessary early bonding. I felt like she the baby was not really mine, she was my mother's. since my mother had had control over her birth, had named her, and had had her the first 6 months. Also, I thought that being an amnesiac was a lot like being crazy. Then I understood why the baby looked big for a newborn and why the scar on my chest it was like in the area below the chest and above the stomach was almost healed already. over the last six months, it had started to close up so it was no longer a fresh scar. Although it was still sore. The scar was shaped like a small cross In an earlier scene, before I went into the hospital to have the baby I was pregnant, and very much afraid of the upcoming pain of labor. I was terrified of the pain. The truth was that in a way I was relieved that my mother had had me anesthetized because I had actually been very afraid of the labor pains; but I pretended to be outraged, at some level. But I was especially outraged that my mother had chosen the name without consulting me. When I found that out, that's when I walked out of the party. My father was at the party.\n",

He was running in and out of cars, moving cars, and also parked cars, and also through Boston Common, and there were bees in the air, and I was chasing after him, not stopping for the cars, people, or anything, just chasing after him. I was very worried about him. it looked like it was going to be very hard to catch him and then finally I caught him. when I did catch him, I just held him in my arms and hugged him, like a mother. During the chase, at one point, a woman said something to me disapprovingly, something about my being irresponsible, like why the hell was he running through the streets like that, it was dangerous, etc. and I lost my temper and screamed at her, What would you do if he was running through the cars and there were bees, etc. Would not you chase after him? etc. , and then the woman understood my side and stopped being critical and apologized. The mother was relieved that I had brought her son back. The mother was Mrs. H.\n",

      "Denise was in a car accident and died. She had given birth to twins girls, I think either just before or just after. She and Michael had been living together but had not married; this had happened just before their wedding was supposed to take place,  so it meant they could never be married  the children, therefore, would never be legitimate. One of the two babies might not survive, she is still in the hospital. I am concernedwondering about how the babies are going to get fed, who is going to give them milk, and Mike tells me that Beth Moses had fed her once,  he seems to be hinting or suggesting that maybe I should feed her now. At first, when I called Michael he did not tell me Denise was dead; he just said she was drifting in and out of consciousness, because he did not want to shock me, but then he tells me the truth, that she is dead. No one is clearsure how he will manage to take care of this baby now. Denise's friends will help, it seems. I ask about Denise's parents' reaction. Before all this happened, I was supposed to go to Denise's wedding,  was supposed to be a bridesmaid at the wedding, but I was conflicted because another good friend of mine was getting married elsewhere in another state the same night,  I was supposed to be a bridesmaid there too,  I wanted to try to do both.  so I was going to try to go to one wedding  then at about 730P. M. or so catch a plane  go to Denise's wedding. Even though I'd arrive too late to be a bridesmaid, at least I would be at the wedding for part of the time. But for some reason I miss the plane,  there are no other flights that night, so I end up not getting to the wedding at all,  I know that both Mike  Denise are hurt and insulted. Anyway. I had heard she was dead even before I'd talked to Michael, but I had not called, like a whole day had passed before I'd even called. So then when I do call, I act surprised, so he will not know that I already knew. My reaction to Denise's death is pretty strong,  it includes anger. I am just very angry that this could happen, angry at the injustice of it, angry at the universe, at G. d. In another scene another dream, maybe? there are lions.

      "Harold Langlois goes out to dinner with me and two other people from the Urban Studies program. One is a guy who graduated from the program many years ago and the other I think, I cannot remember anything about the other. Harold tells his version of events, like trying to justify it, and this time he tells it that there was only one woman not 3, not 4, not 5. I do not expose him in front of the other people but afterwards, in the car, I am driving and the guy is in the passenger seat, and I tell him, I had lunch with Maureen and I know this was not just one woman, it was 5. Before that, while still at the dinner, I confronted Harold but in a gentle, polite way. I said 'Harold, you are the most brilliant teacher I ever had, but I have to tell you honestly, I really do not find the allegations hard to believe. ' He does not really indeciph. that. Later, when I'm driving with this guy, we are driving like up a spiral into a parking garage, like one of those spiral parking garages. I am a little drunk. It looks like I am going to crash because I do not have word missing. probably 'control' of the car, but as it turns out we do not crash.\n",

      "I am with my mother, on a journey, near a big mountain. It is on Monday, and my appointment with Lila is for Tuesday morning, but there is a chance that if I leave her a phone message by Monday afternoon perhaps, she could see me on Monday, because I really want to see her. We left it like that, that I could call to schedule an appointment, but so far I did not call. Anyway, I think this is somewhere in California. Like, near where Renni might be. Maybe Southern California. Like near a university, I think. And something happens, and my mother tells me that my father never really committed suicide. That whole story was just a big mistake. She tells me, they never really did find him on the floor of the garage, no, the story did not go like that at all. Instead, the story went like this he was in the house, and he had to go out for some reason, and he just got into the car, it was my mother's car, and she drove a standard or some other kind of unusual car, a car that he did not know how to drive, and so he could not get the car to go, but he was in the garage, so he went back inside and somewhere inside the house he fell asleep from the smoke. So, he did not really kill himself. He was not trying to die, he died while he was trying to live; it was not a suicide at all. It all depends on the story you tell. Lila, Lila, I need Lila. I need Lila. I need Lila. Anyway, I am thinking, oh, wow, all these years have gone by, and my whole life I've been telling myself the wrong story. Wow. And I did not even know it. How could it be? And now I have to go back and correct everything, and tell Lila the truth, about how the first story I told her was not the real story, and how my father did not want to die at all, he wanted to live, and he wanted me to live, and he loved me, but it's so confusing because it is different from the story that I know. And you are not supposed to suddenly change the story after you have been telling it for years and years. I do not know what to make of this new information that my mother has just discovered, which I never had access to before. It is perplexing. I am thinking, wow, perhaps I never really knew him at all. Perhaps I really had no idea what was going on for him on the day that he died, here I've been thinking he wanted so much to die when perhaps what the real story is is that he wanted so much to live. To live, live, live, live, live. But who can really know? It's so strange, so strange how you can never really know the truth about anything or anyone, all you can do is try to tell the best story, i. e. the one that makes your life the fullest, otherwise what is the point of telling a story at all, if not to make a life more interesting? Anyway, I really want to call Lila to make an appointment with her for this afternoon Monday, but it's now sometime around 3 or 4 o'clock, and I doubt that she will be able to see me today, but perhaps if she is checking her machine every hour or so and she says Yes, come in today, I could still come in today, before she is finished working for the day. I am trying to call her, to leave her a message. Earlier, there was another part, when I am in the car with my mother, someone else is driving the car, and my mother tells me something about my father having had grandiose delusions. And I think, Oh, she probably means like Jeffrey, like the kind of stuff Jeffrey used to talk about. And I am sure that my father never had psychiatrically grandiose delusions, like real psychiatric grandiosity, so I ask my mother, and my mother says, Oh yes, yes, he had grandiose delusions, but when I probe her to be more specific, as it turns out what she is describing is not that grandiose at all. It really does not sound that bad, like he may have been mildly delusional but he was not seriously delusional, not like in the psychiatry meaning of grandiose. I realize that my mother does not understand very much at all, indecipherable three words had she had this important piece of information which is very useful to me. I ask her something like, why did she never tell me, why did she let me think for all these years that my father wanted to die, that he committed suicide, and she cannot really say why she let me have the wrong impression, she cannot really answer. It's strange, it was only because he was in the wrong kind of car that he died, it was some kind of car that he did not know how to drive, so he was stuck there. And I also think, mmm, that, in a way, has a legacy of its own, like what Camus used to say about the absurdity of life, and what Harold used to teach us, about catastrophe theory, and about how crazy life is in general, because it seems almost ironically humorous or allegorical that my father died because of a car that was one type instead of another, like a story that shows just how absurd life is, that kind of story also has a legacy. But it is a legacy I can live with better than the one about how he so much wanted to die. Life is kind of crazy, and unpredictable, and you have to be able to have a kind of humor about it, not the humor of denial or running away, but the sad humor of understanding, like a sad smile, to say, yes, yes, that is just how life is, and it can never be comprehended, but at least we are deep enough to recognize it and to see that there is not really an answer. except like that poem about how if there is any answer, oh, how does it go.\n",

Only the next thing you know, when we are looking for the lake, it turns out we are right upon it and Uncle Joel is now driving right into the lake. The car starts to fill up with water fairly very quickly. It is terrifying, but we have to keep calm in order to know what to do. There is still a little air, but it is harder and harder to breathe. Somehow we both manage to get our respective sides open and to get out of the car. To breathe again, to breathe again is important. Uncle Joel now wants to just give up and go back, but I still have my suitcase in the car and I do not want to just abandon my suitcase. So I say, Come on, let's try to bring the car in; Uncle Joel is so traumatized by what just happened that he wants to just forget about the luggage but I do not give up so easily. I want to give it a try, so I say, Come on, Come on, Come on, you have to try. He does exert himself and we are able to bring in the car enough to save the luggage. We are still just recovering from the breathing difficulty, We are still shaken, shaken by the fact that it was a damned close call, thank God there was still a chance to open the door and get out of the car before the air ran out, thank God for that. but it was too damn close, too damn close a call.

      "I am going to my car, feeling safe, feeling happy, in an area that seems safe. Or at least, I never really thought about how it might not be safe. Suddenly as I approach my car I feel haunted because I realize it might not be safe, I pass by some man in a car that at first scares me but as it turns out he's not the culprit, then suddenly another car blocks me and a man gets out and I am terrified. I realize that I made a big mistake coming here by myself. I realize that he will probably kill me and at the very least he's going to rape me. I'm afraid and I think, not again, I cannot go through this again. He attacks me in my car and the next thing you know he and some other people have kidnapped me under water, there is like a way that somehow I am breathing even though I am underwater, it is like an underwater world, it's scary, but at least I'm not dead, but what happens is, just before this guy pushes my car into the water so that it sinks down down down I disappear, I go far away, I cannot explain it because it's very weird and new and ineffable, as I am sinking down I am also disappearing, going far away, I'm scared even writing about this, once you are that far away it's hard to come back, it's easier to get far away then it is to come back, Anyway. now I'm in this underworld, and now the dream changes so that I'm not the protagonist anymore, now I'm watching it from a distance, instead of being the protagonist I am now a spectator or a witness, like someone who is watching from afar, but the switch is so sudden, it's instantaneous, like a light switch, one minute I'm there and the next I'm far away, but in any case, I still see what's going on but I'm seeing it from a distance now. Anyway. so Redacted First. Name1 is there underwater with this man, but she is not dead, she's alive, she's breathing underneath the water like a mermaid, like a fish, then what happens is, the girl's mother is worried about her, and the rest of her family, her other family members, are not worried, they are like, Oh, you have not heard from her in a day, so what, no big deal, but her mother is like, No, I know that something is wrong, she has not called me in a day and I know that something is wrong, then somehow they . the rest of her family . get brought into this underwater world but she can see them but they cannot see her, in other words there is no contact, she can only see them from a distance, she wants to reach out to them but the man will not allow her, meanwhile her poor mother is really worried and even hysterical, her mother really wants to contact her but can't, and the water is thick and makes everything go in slow motion, like you cannot move as fast in water, it thickens everything, every step you take, Anyway. it's frustrating because the girl can see her mother but her father sic cannot see her.\n",

I think the person is probably dead. Then I see that the person is alive. Actually, it's a woman. It looks like her knee is cut up very badly. The worst injury is to her knee. But she is hurt in other places too. She has a hint of lipstick on. Then, as it turns out, she is not a woman but a man, well, a transvestite actually. I look a little closer and see that she's not symmetrical, like, half of her is like a man, half is like a woman, For example her makeup. on one side her eyelashes are curled, on the other they're ordinary, etc. She had a wig on that she takes off. I see if somebody called on their cellular phone, 911, to help this person. At first I just assume someone did, but then I remember how in social psychology we learned that innocent bystanders often assume that and it leads to nobody's helping at all, so I try, more aggressively, to see whether someone did phone someone did. I also want to see if in one of the cars the traffic is backed up now, by this there is a doctor or nurse who can give himher some immediate medical attention.\n",

      "4. I am in Bethel, at NTL. I have gone there for the 50th anniversary celebration. I am somewhere in the main area or perhaps in an area near Don Coverdale's house. There is a man here who has just arrived, not long before I did. Somehow he had some kind of serious accident, I do not know if it was a car accident or some other kind of accident, I think he may have been injured in a scuba diving accident, and it looks like he is dead. His head is about 34 severed from his body, so it looks pretty hopeless. And at first it feels like there is almost no pulse or heartbeat. But then I andor someone else with me hold together the top part of the body and the bottom part of the body, we hold the two parts together, and when we hold them, press them, together like that, we notice that he is in fact still alive, that his heart is. miraculously!. still beating. I put my hand against his chest and find that not only is his heart still beating, it is thumping, it is thumping fairly hard. I start to feel a little bit of hope, even though it looks like this is against the odds since the top part of his body is 34 severed from the bottom part of his body, but it's definitely worth a try now to resuscitate him. We kick into action like we did at the Weirlab in Andros. JulieQuest is around, I think Rad is around, and several others. Alisa Dennis is around but for some reason she is not helping. She is being rather sullen and is not participating or helping with us, and I am angry at her. As we are all trying hard to save this man, I keep thinking of Uma and the whole situation reminds me so much of what happened with Uma, and at times I even mistake Uma's name for this man's name. As we are holding together the two halfs of his body which were severed and trying to resuscitate him, at a certain point his body starts to move as if to a rhythmic beat of music, it is almost as if he is trying to move or to dance and when we hold his body together he is still able to. I think, and maybe even say, maybe we should put on the Grateful Dead, because it seems that this man loved the Grateful Dead, and I am thinking that maybe when he hears the Grateful Dead he will really start to come alive again, kick, move, get his strength and vitality back, etc. The song I thought of humming or that was on my mind. Sunshine Daydream. Though I am also aware that it's kind of ironic to mention a group called The Grateful Dead at a time like this, i. e. when we are working so hard to bring him back to life and to keep him alive. Besides, I think that the music might interfere with our need to be able to communicate with each other during the resuscitation. I shout a few times to Alisa for help but she basically refuses to be involved in the resuscitation effort or help. Other people, however, do, and there is a good amount of teamwork and collaboration in order to save this man's life. Even though it seems virtually impossible that his heart could still be thumping when his body has been 34 severed from his head, I think to myself, Well, this must be a man who really wants to live, who has an unusually strong drive toward life, life. drive, much stronger than the average person's, a very strong compelling desire to live, life. force, life. energy, will to live, very very compelling and powerful, enough to defy logic or prediction. This man is Bill Ressler, or someone who is just like Bill Ressler, and I recall from the days of the 10. day course that he did indeed have a strong life. force in him. energy, strength, vitality, passion, will to live. I am trying to focus on leadingdirecting the psychologicalinterpersonal parts of the resuscitation effort, like telling people you do this, you do that, encouraging JulieQuest, encouraging people not to give up, to have hope to keep trying, to stay motivated, keep working, etc. and Julie is doing most of the actual CPR, or is about to, and at a certain point she asks me if I also know how to do CPR in case she gets tired, at least the part about breathing, i. e. do I know how to breathe into another person, I mention that I learned how many years ago I am thinking of the course I took at Camp Tevya but that I would not remember how to do it today, and that I would not want to take a chance on doing it wrong. JulieQuest seems to feel that like it or not, I might have to. , i. e. if she really gets tired and needs a break. JulieQuest is a little slow in starting the CPR, a little hesitant, and I have to encourage her, remind her that time is of the essence, remind her that it's not hopeless, that his heart is thumping but his injury is quite serious so it's extremely important that we institute the CPR in order to keep his heart pumping blood through his body and keep his heart working properly, keep his heart working and the blood flowing, or he will die. JulieQuest, it's important! You must! Begin now, please, begin, do not wait, do not hesitate, we must try, there is a chance, there is still a chance that we can save him and we must try. I keep thinking of Uma, flashing back to Uma's death, wishing that we could have saved Uma too. but we can only save the living life is for the living. we cannot save the ones who have already died poor Uma, however much we long to, like in triage, we must focus our efforts on the ones who have a chance however small to stay alive, and nurture that chance, build on that chance, strengthen that chance, increase that chance. life is for the living, and this man has a chance of being revivedstaying alive, being kept alive, if we can keep the top part of his body connected with the bottom part of his body, if we can keep the two parts together, if we can hold him together until he is restored, until he comes back to life, until he is healed, until he is well, until he is strong. jagged line, the line where he was severed is a jagged line. When I first got there, I was confused about where everyone was and what I had missed, rushing around trying to find everyone. Later, when this thing happens, I think maybe I was meant to be in exactly this place at exactly this time so that I could help save this man's life. Earlier. when I first got to the NTL thing, there was a staircase that looks like a kind of spiral staircase. And all along the staircase, as you wind around from step to step, on each step is some object associated with the history of NTL or with a person from NTL. At a certain point as I am slowly making my way through the steps I ask someone who helped to organize this whole thing he is a man around in his 50s or 60s, slightly feminine voice, from California I think, who has been very active in NTL. reminds me of a guy who was active in ASD whom I saw at the Dreams conference, in fact I think it is that guy, Stan Krippner, anyway, I ask him if there's anything here that belonged to Jack Gibb or that's about Jack Gibb or is associated with Jack Gibb, and he says yes and points to a step near me where there is a small exhibit that was given by Jack Gibb's family that came from Jack's house, one of Jack's special possessions, I'm not sure what it is but it looks like part of it is like those beautiful delicate animals made of hand. blown glass, a little glass animal, hand. blown, and I think there may be a round mirror at the bottom, it may rest on a little round mirror, or on a little circle of transparent glass, transparent glass almost like a pond, that has reflective properties. But I am not sure what this object is or how to interpret or understand it, and I wish Jack were here so I could ask him. What's important to me, however, is that it belonged to Jack, and so to me, regardless of what it is supposed to be or represent, it is precious, simply because it belonged to Jack and he donated it to this exhibit. The man that I asked the question asks me, did you know Jack? and I say Yes, Jack was my mentor. for the work I did at International College. I pause before adding the International College part so that I am emphasizing that he was my mentor in a more general way. A few minutes later, I wonder if perhaps Jack could still be alive, maybe he is not really dead, and for a few moments I actually have myself almost believing that's possible, but then I remember that this man said did you know Jack?, and I realize that if Jack were still alive he would have asked me do you know Jack? rather than did you know Jack? Then I also recall seeing the phrase In memoriam in the NTL brochure. I feel sad that Jack died just a couple of years before this event, I wish that I could have seen him here once more. But if he's dead two years already, there's nothing I can do about it, I cannot bring him back to life, I have to accept it, life is for the living. Much earlier, I saw Alisa and we got in a big fight, there was a lot of tension between us, now I am worried that the black women at the conference will take her side simply because she's black and will think the fight had something to do with my being white and will not want to have anything to do with me. She is not behaving toward me as a friend should behave. A part of me thinks, Oh, we'll get through this just like we've gotten through so many other things in our friendship, and a part of me thinks no, this is different, this time there is really a chance that our friendship will not continue. I think about how even at the peak of our friendship, for example when I wrote her a card on Andros, I acknowledged that there was always the chance that a day would come when we are no longer close friends, no longer an active part of each other's lives.\n",

      "1. I am at UMNDNJ, breezing by the reception area on what seems like an ordinary day, I'm by the mailboxes about to check my box, and suddenly a bunch of phone calls come in for me, all at once it seems. I think maybe Gillian, David Saltiel, a couple of other relatives and old friends. And one of the calls is from Estelle Lesser. I think it's something related to the case, like a whole bunch of people are calling me for comments for the news or something, and I am kind of proud and excited that I'm getting all this attention. I decide to take the call from Estelle Lesser, I'm in a good mood, ready to chat, etc. , then I sense in her voice that something's wrong. Then I sense that someone has died. What occurs to me is that maybe Marty has died or maybe Nanny has died. And in thinking of either of these possibilities I feel disappointment and dismay and I hope it's not true. I start to ask her about these possibilities but she's not responding. Then suddenly, all at once, without warning, she tells me that my mother has died. I go into shock, absolute numbing depersonalized out of my body far. away not. real as. if. electrocuted shock. And numbness. I go into a state of absolute numbness. numb, numb, numb. And only because of the numbness am I able to go on with asking questions, communicating, etc. otherwise I would have just lost my mind or something. I start to ask for details. I want to know how she died. it is very important to me to know how she died. what happened. I feel an intense need to know exactly what happened. Meanwhile on another line David has called too and I can tell from something in his tone of voice that this is really true, because Estelle called I did not really believe it, I did not think it could really be true. Like, when I was thinking of people or naming people, it did not even occur to me that one could be my mother. So I am asking Estelle, David, and anyone who's on any of the other lines, Tell me what happened. please. tell me what happened. Estelle tells me something like that my mother either drowned or died of carbon monoxide poisoning, it's not clear which, because apparently she was driving in a car I think she may have been with David Saltiel at the time and she. some person tells me. stopped to avoid hitting some little kitties, or a cat with her little kitties. and in the process of stopping like that in the middle of the road, her car somehow ends up getting flooded filled with water and she cannot breathe, there's not enough air. But as I am told this story and I picture the whole thing in my mind, I cannot understand or figure out whether she died from drowning. like the water eventually enveloped the car. or from suffocation. like trapped in her car with not enough air because the water is rising. And it is important to me to know the difference, to know which one is true. But no one will give me any answers, there is only silence, silence, and more silence, nothing but silence on the question of how she died. Meanwhile I still do not really believe that she died, at least not fully. I am like at the stage of entertaining the possibility that she may have died but I'm nowhere near the stage of hearing or taking in that she actually did die. Yet I heard the words, so I am able to repeat the words, numbly, like a numb parrot, as if they do not mean anything, my mother just died, my mother just died. And other people around me also seem to react as if it's not really real. not really true. not my mom's old friends and relatives. they do care, believe it and are upset, but I mean like the people I am seeing around UMDNJ, like for example, I see Michelle Daniel. I tell her my mother just died. She says something rather banal, like tells me she's sorry or something, but it's not like she really realizes what this means or how serious this. Then for some reason Bev Greene is around, like she has come in to this area around UMDNJ for something. Like there is something she wants to go over or discuss related to the project or paper I did for school. So before we start, I say to Bev we are seated at a big oval table. Listen, there's something I have to tell you before we start working on this. my mother just died. Bev says she's sorry. and she does seem to feel sorry at some level, but she does not suggest that perhaps we should forego working on this project now so that I can tend to my own needs and healing, like she really does not take it that seriously, at least, not seriously enough to suggest we stop working, and likewise I see Sue Esquilin around and I tell her that my mother just died, and just like with Bev, she is sorry but is not about to tell me I should take the day off and go home and tend to my own healing and recovery. it is like, each person I encounter is focused on their own narrow self. interest, and so is not able to be truly available to and responsive to me nor attune to what's really going on inside me. And this surprises me because, for example, I think it should be quite obvious that if your mother has died and you have just learned of that fact, you cannot be expected to function normally, concentrate, attend, focus, etc. Meanwhile deep down inside me beneath all the many layers of numbness and thickness is an absolutely terrified little girl, a terror unlike any I have known in all my life, It's a Catch 22 because the very person I would turn to for comfort at a time like this. the only person in the world who could comfort me. is also the one who has died. So when I think about comfort or finding comfort, there is not any, there just is not any and that's that. none. No place for me to turn to for solace, only to my diary and maybe I use that as a substitute for a person, but diaries are not tactile. no one to give me a hug or stroke my hair or my cheek or help me through this. Meanwhile, I am still trying hard to find out how she actually died, and it seems like no one can get the facts quite straight and everyone is telling me something different. later I go away from UMDNJ, like I finish my work day a little early I do go on working for sometime after hearing the news. I leave. Oh, before that, I was going to either be late for or miss the David Pollens seminar in play therapy as a result of this news Anyway. I leave UMDNJ and arrive to a house, a house where Marty is staying and people are sitting around in mourning, I think among them are Estelle, maybe Stan, David Saltiel, and others. They are like in one room, like the living room, and meanwhile I have not seen Marty yet. After a while I start to realize that Marty must have been absolutely devastated, he loved my mother so much, and needed her, and had expected to spend many more years together, and never expected this terrible tragedy to happen. So now I'm concerned about Marty. and also, this has happened just shortly before we were to go on the cruise together as one family, like just days or a week or two before the scheduled cruise. And I know he'll be upset about this aspect of the timing, and feel so disappointed, and I do too, in fact, when they first notified me one of the things I keep thinking about is the cruise and how we were so close to going on the cruise. Now that I hear where Marty is, I think about how maybe I should order him to encourage him to go on the cruise anyway, maybe he needs the relaxation and stress. reduction and it would still be good for him to go ahead, even without my mother and even with her having recently died. This looks like the house in Wayland now, and I think Marty is in a room that is my room, and when I picture him I imagine two things one, I imagine that he's walking or running on a treadmill, and the other is that he's crying really hard, that he's in absolute despair over this and he's just crying and crying and crying. I am not sure how, or even whether, to approach him, and it occurs to me that maybe I should just let him be, although he does probably want to be found, since he's locked up in his room like this. I need my mother but she's gone, I keep trying to get used to the ideafact that she's not corporeal anymore, does not have a body or exist on earth, only exists as a memory and an image inside me, but I just cannot get used to that idea, it just does not seem real to me. Also, after I get the news, I recall that I had recently had some dreams in the days leading up to the day I got the news, that I now see, in retrospect, as having been warning dreams, dreams that presaged that something like this would or could happen, the last dream even specifically refers to or depicts something related to the water or a car accident in water or a car being swallowed up in water, and now I feel like I could kick myself because I should have known, I should have known to pay attention to those dreams and I should have known that something like this could happen at any time. I think about, why did not I pay attention to those warning dreams? And yet, a part of me is also not clear about whether anything at all that I or anyone else could have done would have prevented this, i. e. maybe it was destiny. Like, dreamed this, And the need for comfort which no one will fulfill. to be comfortless and have nowhere to turn for solace. I feel like a frightened little girl inside, and I want my mommy, Meanwhile I still have not been able to figure out, picture, imagine or know what killed her, how she actually died, it is all so confusing and makes no sense to me. if a person dies, there must be something in particular killed them, and in this case I just do not understand what. And I want to know, was it the water or the lack of oxygen, the drowning or the asphyxiation? I also think about Leon Prostakov's mother and how she walked into the sea, and wonder if maybe getting swallowed up by the ocean somehow runs in our family. In the mourning, when people are sitting around the house in mourning, somehow I get the feeling that the other people here, the adults, who knew and loved my mother. David, Rhoda, Estelle  Stan, etc. , recognize how serious this is much more than I do, how serious and permanent and real. It's like I can tell that they can tell that I do not yet understand how real this is and what this means for my life, the implications this has for the rest of my life, for them it is real whereas for me it is still not real, I am still in shock and not really getting it. I wake up absolutely terrified. this is a terrible, terrible nightmare. After several moments I realize that it was all a terrible nightmare that I have now\n",

      "I'm in Stephanie's car, because she's giving me a ride somewhere from UMDNJ, and while we're in her car, she hits another car and makes a dent in it. it is a white car that she dents, and it is my car, i. e. my car is around here somewhere, parked somewhere it may be kind of in our way. I'm not sure and as she is driving. pulling out of the parking lot or something I think, Stephanie hits this car and makes a dent in it. The dent is on the side I think driver's side, but I'm not sure, center, and is small. it is not a large dent, but it is visible, i. e. it's not something that can be completely ignored. But it's not terrible. I feel dismay because even though this is a used car I bought it not too long ago, used. I bought it used, it was in good condition and did not have any dents in it at all, i. e. the white surface of the car was completely intact. no dents. So it bothers me now to see this and notice this dent. And I also wonder if it will alter the resale value of the car. like others might see it and think that the car itself is not good, but in fact the car is very good, i. e. the engine, inner part of the car, how it runs, etc. but others might not believe that when they see the dent. Also, now that this has occurred, since Stephanie was giving me a ride, i. e. doing me a favor, I am not supposed to show that I am upset and annoyed with her for hitting my car, I am supposed to act like it's no big deal and that it does not matter. This dent is not bad enough to make it worthwhile to report this to the insurance company and I have to act mature, so I cannot show my dismay, I have to act like I do not really care that she did this and it's no big deal. Oh, it was already a used car. it's ok, I say, or something to that effect. Stephanie seems to feel badly that she did this but not to think it's a big deal. Also, I wonder about the unconscious motivations toward me, i. e. was this a reflection of some unconscious hostility that she harbors toward me? In another part of this dream my laptop computer is plugged in somewhere and is on the pavement near this parking lot, and at one point when I see it there, I think after Stephanie dents my car, I become nervous and afraid about leaving my computer exposed like this, on the pavement, where anybody could hit it. indeciph. looks like 'but there must have' been some reason that I had wanted it there in the first place. Anyway, I unplug my computer and lift it up, and take it back, where it will have more protection and not be so exposed. I wonder I worry for a moment whether in the time it was left here may be 'out here' any mosquito may have flown into the slit into where you put the disks, because if that occurred it might mess up the whole computer and cause it to malfunction. I think it's pretty unlikely that this would have occurred so I try not to worry about it too much and to tell myself that that it will probably be fine, but the thought does cross my mind, and I hope my computer is fine.\n",

      "3. I am somewhere, watching. I see a car go off the road. It already looks pretty scary and dangerous when suddenly I next also see the car really lose control and flip over and go off some kind of cliff. When I see that part, that second part, I know that the person in the car has not got a chance and must be dead. I am with at least one other person, who witnesses this with me, and also understands this fact. Now, the night is very very icy and stormy, there is ice all over the place, lots and lots of ice, the storm is very bad, with chunks of ice falling and flying, etc. , so it's quite obvious that it's very dangerous to text trails off In seeing what happened with the car, the way it slipped on the ice and flipped over . so suddenly, so instantaneously . one minute this woman driving the car was alive and the next she was flipping suddenly, flipping over, and presumably dead . is very haunting and leaves an indelible impression on us because we all realize . those of us who are watching . that it could just as easily have been any one of us, that's the thing that we all realize so powerfully . this is terrifying . that it could have been any one of us, any one of us who are driving on that road, down that same road . that's what's so scary . terrifying . that's what makes this a nightmare . several of us likewise were driving down that same road. We were on that same road, at the same time . during the storm! My God . it was a close call . any one of us could have flipped on the ice and tipped over like that, and been instantly killed, any one of us . the line between life and death is so fucking thin, my God, it only takes a moment, a split second, you can be driving along one minute and be gone in an instant . we are all aware . those of us who witnessed this . that it could just as easily have been any one of us. Then, a little later, I'm with some of these friends that witnessed this incident with me, we have all gotten together at the home of one person, in order to be together, talk about what happened, and also, we want to make a film about it, we've decided that we want to make a film about it, but even though we came here saying we were going to make a film about it so we'd always remember what we saw and the lessons inherent in that experience, now that we are all here together, we are not, instead of working on the film as we said we would we're all just hanging out and talking . small. talk kind of stuff . and I feel like in a sense we are all colluding in betraying the memory of the person we came here to remember, our friend who flipped over in the car. Since we did not get anything serious done this time, we decide to meet again and give it another try, write that film in our friend's honor so we will remember the lesson, but each time we get together . I think we get together two more times . we neglect to write her story and honor her memory and instead we just hang out and make small talk. I feel frustrated and disappointed because I feel we are colluding in a betrayal, some sort of betrayal. I wake up terrified.\n",

      "Graduation. I was helping to collect gifts and mail them out. Parents had given them to the school to make sure they got to the kids through the mail. I made sure each one had a good label, and sent them off. A guy I know was trying to buy alcohol. We were at the airport. The car was on, and already moving without a driver, I was in the backseat, and he was loading it. The car started moving faster and faster so I got into the driver's seat and took off. The guy was still at the airport, so I planned to turn around as soon as I could. The road was a two. lane highway. I was going pretty fast. A motorcycle came from the opposite direction but was in my lane, trying to scare me. It swerved just before it hit me. There was an earthquake. So an overpass crumbled and many cars collided at the intersection. I got out and videotaped people's responses.\n",
      "==========================\n",
      "Im in my bedroom in Wayland or somewhere that looks like Wayland. My mother and I are having a fight ' a big, major fight. We are shouting at each other very loudly and intensely, and also, to some extent, fighting physically. I am saying things like I hope you die! We are pushing, shoving, wrestling, shouting. What happened is 'I was on the phone trying to listen to the man tell me where my car is, and my mother had the TV turned on loud, and I asked her if she could please turn down the TV for just 2 minutes so I could hear what this man was saying on the phone, and she refused ' she wouldnt turn down the volume. And I only wanted her to do so for a minute or so, so I could hear! Thats how this fight started. The man on the phone ' he did me a special favor ' he arranged that my car would be towed to a bridge near the Cape, so that I could pick it up on my way back to New York or wherever, instead of having to completely go out of my way. What happened before that is'I was working for some sort of hospital that serves children ' reminds me of The Bridge, only I think the children are younger. And its also kind of like a day hospital for children, and I have a position there, like I did in college. And its nighttime, and for some reason I want to take the van and do something, its just going to be some sort of quick errand or something, in or near Manhattan I think, maybe. And Im not really supposed to take the van for non. work. related things, though we are allowed to take it and drive it if a need arises thats work. related, i. e. for the kids. I get in the van and start driving, and after a short while theres a narrow street, and I am going down it one way, and this other car is going down it the other way, but I assume and trust that we will each move a little to the side, i. e. , I to the right, he to the left, so that we can both pass and not i. e. , making room for each other ' or actually ' but when I move to the right a little as needed, he does not move at all, he just keeps barrelling forward, without regard for me, and so we have a collision, and somehow a third car is involved too, ends up crashing into us as well. The crash is a big one, with a big impact, scary, loud, intense, a big intense crash, with all three cars, though the worst of it is this one car that was facing me, and me ' the third one is slightly more peripheral. And the impact is loud and harsh. ' At first it seems like there may well have been a serious injury, but then I quickly assess that Im ok ' not seriously injured ' and I check to see that the other guy is ok ' and the 3rd guy, though the impact was harsh for him too, has already taken off. He literally took only a second or so, pulled his car out of the 3. car wreckpile, and drove away ' it gave me the impression that he had something to fear related to, for example, not being able to afford any potential liability or losses or payments, needing to speed away quickly to spare himself the risk of any involvement in this matter. So, hes gone ' but it wasnt his fault anyway. I want to take off too, because I dont want to get in trouble for using the van for this personal errand, and also, I dont want to be towed, I want to be able to drive away, and go where Im going, I dont want to have to be at the mercy of a tow. truck driver dependent on someone else to take me to where I need to go, at someone elses mercy. I want to avoid having to submit to a tow. truck driver at all costs! The van looks pretty intact, and I think that despite the harsh impact of the crash, I can probably just quickly get it together and drive away, before the police come I fear theyll arrive any minute, then theyll have to make an accident report, and Ill never get away. But I cant manage to drive away, because even though the car looks fairly intact and I am basically ok to drive, though scared and shaken, the steering wheel has broken off. It has literally broken off ' so that theres only the stick sticking up, i. e. the stick that the steering wheel would be placed at the end of, to move the car with and to steer with ' its completely broken off, and theres no way this stick ' so even if I could get it together enough to get the car started and get the car to run, theres no way for me to steer the car, nothing to steer with, and since its completely broken off, its not something I can control ' much as I want to control this and seize the moment and drive away, I absolutely cannot control this absence of a steering wheel ' theres no way I can drive the car without it. So I am trying to figure out what to do, becoming anxious that I cant just drive away, and worried about all the consequences and hassles that will ensue when the police arrive, somewhere in this, when it first happened, I also did initially call to the other driver are you ok?, to make sure he was ok, and he was. He has no choice but to wait for the police to come because his car is a wreck ' he cant go anywhere. Next scene ' Im in a restaurant with a bunch of people ' new friends I have made or new people I have come to know ' reminds me a little of a Weirlab type of thing, I think. And I have been here for a time, and now, because of this crash, it is time for me to leave and go back and deal with all this, so I have to leave a little earlier than the others, so Im the one whos going around and saying goodbye to each person, and getting special hugs and special attention and so forth ' individualized, toward me. Although there are both men and women in this group reminds me a little of my LGI group, with people like red. haired Danny and all, Gingy, its mostly the men who are giving me attention, the men here are very much into me, have strong feelings for me, some idealization of me, lots of attention, they give me lots of attention. So, as Im going around this table a large rectangular table, with lots of people, plus there are several smaller tables, this is some sort of big event, like a goodbye party or a last. night. of. the. trip party or something, the men are all giving me big hugs and a lot of attention and warmth reminds me a little of the jurors in my case, and how they were with me. The women see this and have somewhat mixed feelings about it ' on the one hand, they too have basically warm feelings and affection for me, on the other hand, they feel a little jealous of all this male attention Im receiving and of the intensity of the mens feelings for me. But for the most part, the women too are giving me warm goodbyes. What happens is, Im basically going around to each person at the table and giving them a hug, and although the quality of the hug varies somewhat person by person, for the most part these are close, warm, intense embraces. There is one woman ' she reminds me very, very much of that woman I faced in the Weirlab the one with the short curly hair, short woman during that exercise ' I think it may even be her ' and when I get to her, we French kiss ' it is like a somewhat sexual kiss ' right on the line between a regular, friendship. type kiss. on. the. lips, and a clearly, unquestionably sexual kiss. on. the. lips ' right on that line ' but it does feel sexual to me, feels like more than just a regular kiss between friends ' and actually, this was a question in my kisses with the men too, and with most of the people Im going around saying goodbye to here ' we would kiss on the lips, our mouths would be partly open and partly not open, and it was really ambiguous at times whether it was a friendship kiss or a sexual kiss, and also, there was a question, for most of these contacts, of how much to open my mouth to theirs and how much to close my mouth to theirs ' that interplay between opening and closing ' and it makes me feel a bit awkward, because Im not certain how much to open my mouth and how much to close or seal or pucker it ' with most of the men, I think the kisses were fairly open. mouthed, and with this woman, we are basically French. kissing. And at one point, while this is happening, I also recall that I dreamed that I was kissing this woman ' so I have a deja. vu type experience in kissing her while recalling having had a dream that I kissed her, or an experience like, Wow ' I dreamed this, and now its really happening ' the people here all know about the accident, and know that I have to leave early because of it, thats why theyre all saying goodbye to me as I go around the table to each person. And they all are hoping for me that things work out and that I take care of what needs to be taken care of ' i. e. , they are wishing me the best, though some of the women are a little jealous of the extent of the male attention Ive received. last part of this scene ' me and that woman, French. kissing, it feels good and right to be kissing her in this way, and I have that deja. vu. When I step outside, something related to the tow. truck occurs ' I dont see this visually ' but somehow I sense that a tow. truck driver has now come and taken my car somewhere, and Im worried about where, and hoping that hes not taking it too far out of my way, too far away from where I need to go. I get the sense that the two. truck driver is a nice man, and is going to try to do his best for me. The next scene ' is the scene in Wayland with my mother ' she and I are both in my bedroom ' theres already an atmosphere of tension just from our being here, the TV is on, then the phone rings and the tow. truck driver is trying to tell me when I can pick up the van, and it seems he went to an extra effort to deliver the car to a place near this bridge to the Cape, so it would be easier and more convenient for me to pick it up and go where I need to go, but I cant hear what hes saying because the TV is so loud, and my mother wont turn down the volume ' whats going on in this house and in this room feels so loud and intrusive, so pushy, so overwhelming, so overpowering and violating, intrusive, I feel like theres no space for me, no space for me to be, no space for me to grow, no space for me to play or relax, no place for me to be with, no space for me to let go, no space for me to be, no space for me to be with, no space for me to relax ' I feel anxious and tense ' this whole scene feels so fraught with tension ' the tension is so high ' the anxiety is so high ' I feel like I have to put all my energy into protecting myself and defending myself from being violated and overwhelmed, and theres no energy left over for me to enjoy myself or play or relax or be in the interaction, with spontaneity and freedom and lightness is that what joy is?, its just so fraught with tension and anxiety, I wake up as my mother and I are screaming and fighting and shouting and wrestling, its not a good feeling inside, I feel anxious and angry and desperate and scared.\n",

      "Ok I remember a bunch of things from this dream. First I remember being in some parking lot. It was night time and my friend and I were walking towards my car. This guy started following us so we turned around and walked towards him. It looked like he had a knife in his hand but it turned out to be a paper bag that he was holding. We kinda backed him up to the lit area of the parking lot there was a group of people there and asked him what he wanted. I do not remember what he said but we got the impression he was nice and could be trusted. Maybe even worked at the parking lot. So then he walked us to our car. We got in and he pushed the car do not ask me how backwards and it fell into this ditch. I was PISSED. I was yelling at him asking him why the HELL he did that. Then this female cop walks up and stands next to him, looking down at us. Somehow she felt he was justified for what he did. I remember then we turned the car around and attempted to jump down in the car onto the highway below. We were, of course, successful. That's all I remember in that dream. Although the car plays a role in the next one as well. The next dream had some interesting parts. First I was with my old church group. We were at some event, and I was helping with the music. The guy who was playing the songs had to run somewhere so I was left there. The current song ended so I looked into the pile of music and grabbed some praise  worship song and put it on. I was crouching down behind the table cloth and realized I had no clothes on. No one seemed to notice, I managed to slip some clothes on at that point. I also remember seeing my old pastor in the dream, nothing significant about him sticks out. Then I remember we all went to someone's house. I had been watching MTV Cribs a few days ago and suddenly I am in Ozzy Osbornes house in reality the house was my real next door neighbor's when I used to live w my mom, although somewhat different. His daughter was showing me around the house. I was looking at the pool in the backyard and it had 6 hot tubs around it, most were square and 1 was circular. They were all extremely small, would fit 1 maybe 2 people. The pool itself was a normal size. Then I was still at this house but suddenly lots of people were there. I remember this one chick I went to high school w named wanda was there. Anyway I went to a certain room to sleep for the night. I knew I had to work in the morning. I feel something else was involved with work but I cannot remember what it was. I remember sleeping and then waking up and wanting to go home. So I walked next door to my mom's house. Wanda and one other girl came with me. I was in my room and I was eating a Honey Bun and then I had to go downstairs but for some reason I did not want my mom to see the honey bun so I threw it in a room as I passed it. I get downstairs and I recall my dad being there too. I introduced wanda as wanda's sister for some reason. She was busy looking in the refrigerator for something to eat. Then I am getting ready to go back upstairs and my car the one pushed into the ditch in the previous dream was in the foyer of my mom's house. I thought that was odd, continued to go upstairs. I really wanted to shower and I was going through the bathroom looking for soap, shampoo, etc. My mom had a really cool bathroom cabinet, it had all these little gadgets but no shampoo or soap. I think I then went into her bathroom and grabbed some from there and brought it back to the other bathroom. I then took a shower. That's about all I remember.\n",
      "==========================\n",
      "Ok bits and pieces of this LONG dream, I think it was multiple dreams because I woke up a few times. Ok in one dream I was at work and there was this guy caught in an elevator at our job. It was some new electronic elevator and no one could figure out how to get him out. They needed the key that I had, at least at one point. I had no idea where the key went. However, I really wanted to find it so I could save the day. I was searching all over my bedroom for this key and I finally found it and was able to let him out of the elevator. He had been in there like 2 days. Everyone was happy that I saved him. Then I remember another part of the dream where we were all taking part in this play but it was real life, meaning we had to play these characters in everyday life. I was not with that and pretty much did not comply. I also remember my mom was going to have some kind of party and a lot of kids were going to come and they were all going to sleep in my bedroom and I would sleep in the guest bedroom. I remember going into my bedroom and there was this little kid, he was the size of an infant but infact 5 years old, suffering from some illness. He was totally concious and aware of what was going on. So I picked him up and brought him to my room the guest bedroom and we talked and watched tv and stuff. Then later in the dream he was back to normal size and back in school. He was still sick and quite weak though. I asked him how things were going and he said Okay but mentioned that fact that some kids were teasing him. THen there was this kid over by his locker who he wanted to talk to and therefore I got his attention. I tapped him on the shoulder and he turned around and I introduced my little friend and myself. THen my little friend threw up right there in front of everyone. The kid who we had tapped on the shoulder was very cool about it and did not tease him or anything. The last part of my dream I am in my car and the lead singer of Green Day was outside my car, next to me, on a bike I think. Next thing I know he was on the ground. I opened my car door and he was unconscious, laying right there. I got out, and so did another guy from another car, to see if he was alive. He was. Suddenly he opened his eyes and seemed a little out of it. He was having trouble getting up so I helped him up to his feet. He stood there for a minute kinda dazed and then finally knew where he was. I told him I loved his band and their music. I asked them where their next concert was and he said at the University of New Orleans. THen he gave me a hug and I woke up.\n",

      "At one point I am at my mom's house, sleeping over. I woke up the next day and some friends and I were going to go to some amusement park or something, then suddenly everyone backs out at the last minute. This one male friend of mine says he had 2 free passes and would take me if I still wanted to go, so I said sure. We are driving there and he makes a comment about my car that it's running funny, next thing you know we are crashing. This part gets wild. The car is going all over and suddenly I am no longer in the car I am watching it unfold from above. I above what looks like the Manhattan skyline and our car is now a firetruck that has crashed onto the top of a building similar to the empire state building, how did it get up there, good question. Suddenly I am back in the truck, it's hanging off the edge of the building. I look around for my purse and do not see it, the guy I was with told me to just get out and he would get my purse. I get out, then from inside the truck he throws me my purse. Then suddenly the truck falls and he falls with it, it gets caught and is just barely hanging there, he is hanging outside the truck holding on to some bar. There are people around and the police come in, I frantically tell them to do something, while they take their time assessing the situation. Suddenly the dream goes in some totally different direction. Now I am at some house there are all these girls there who are waiting to go on blind dates, all the girls I see in the room 3 of them I think were black females, one was very heavy set. Then I run into this one girl, white chick with black hair, and the whites of her eyes were light blue. She was talking to me about something, while sucking on a lollipop, but I do not remember the conversation. Then I woke up.\n",

      "Ok i only remember 2 scenes from this dream. Scene 1 I am with some girl and we are walking down this dark street towards this marina. For some reason we are very uneasy, I think there had been a recent rash of murders or something in the area, so we were steady looking over our shoulders to see if anyone was around. I remember as we got closer to the marina the sun was just beginning to rise so we felt better. Scene 2 I am in a car with my mom, we pull up to her driveway and are about to pull in when this van pulls up next to us. He is going in the opposite direction as we are. I look out the window and this guy is sitting in the driver's seat and does not look too nice. I told my mom to HIT THE GAS and she did we start moving forwards, he hits the gas and starts riding along side of us going backwards. In front of us is a parked car so right before we get to it I tell her to slam on her brakes and immediately go in reverse and hopefully he would go flying past and it would give us a chance to turn around. She does that, he goes flying past, and then I woke up. \n",

      "169 Last night, let's see, I had this terrible dream. I dreamt that I was watching this documentary that I had taped on TV, like this news program or something, and it was Celine Dion at her computer going through some MIDI files on her website and Rene Charles, her baby, was on her lap, and she was explaining to the viewing audience which songs that Rene liked and which ones made him nervous and put him on edge, and which ones he liked. And then as the story went along, it showed him in this, Rene and this car and him getting in this major fiery accident. And sigh then it showed him like three or four all of a sudden, trying to fight somebody and somebody was trying to attack him as the ambulance was coming. And he was like, 'I'm three years old and I know how to use a knife. I can take a sparkler and I can burn you. ' And I do not remember exactly what happened. I was like rewinding the tape and it was like playing it over and over again, and that was weird. And then the phone rang and woke me up.\n",

      "173 Last night I had a dream, like Martin Luther King. Well, I'm expecting a surprise visit from my sister Sandra tomorrow, but I do not know what in the world or when in the world because they will not tell me. So anyway, I had this dream that Sandra was here and I was telling her the story of we set up the keyboard on the kitchen counter, of all things, and it was white, the body was white and it was twice the size. I put my two hands on it. There was enough span for the bass clef and the treble clef, and I started playing the accompaniment for Easy Like Sunday morning. And Sandra was like, 'Wow, girl!' And Dad was out in the yard and he could hear it, and then here comes the really bizarre part. We were getting ready to go to this thing at the city Performing Arts Center and Sandra and Dad wanted to go with us, but I guess they were not ready. I was just like in the car in the passenger seat, and the car was just going where I needed it to go. And it was just going on the interstate, 70 mph and it got off the exit at the right exit, and the only problem I had that it needed to be driven was when it came time to park, and since I was not steering it, it parked kind of cockeyed across three other spaces. And it was twirling around a little tiny bit. And I shut off the ignition just in time before it crashed into something. And oh, when I was on the interstate, I could see around me, everybody in the truck behind me. I could see Mom and Sandra in the truck behind me, and so when I got parked, shortly after that Mom pulled up in the truck. And I had to tell her how cockeyed the car parked, and Sandra was there and I did not want Dad to know that I 'drove' even though I did not drive all by myself. And we were going to race home and get him, but we decided, 'Nah,' and I do not remember too much after that, but I do remember that we were all at this like camp fire celebration with these fireworks going off later on. And then I woke up.\n",
      "==========================\n",
      "I do not remember a ton of this dream I do remember I hurt my wrist in the dream and then it was throbbing in pain. I would feel the pain quite vividly. I was telling my friends I thought it was broken. Then I remember another portion where I got in my car and I drove out into the street and another car was driving down the street and could not stop. I remember looking up at the driver in that car and he just looked at me and shrugged as if there was nothing he could do, as if we would have time for all that. And then he hit me but not too hard, right on the drivers side. That's all I remember other then waking up and realizing I had twisted my wrist all up and it was throbbing in pain and asleep. So basically the pain incorporated it's way into my dream. Fun Fun!\n",
      "==========================\n",
      "Going to post these together since they happened the same night and had a common theme, although were completely different. Dream1 First dream I only remember a small part. I am at the airport with my brother who is dead in RL and some other person. We are flying back to Washington. We get to the gate to check in and on the board I do not see the flight for DCA. So I remember getting a bit stressed thinking the flight had been cancelled for something. Then the lady told us the flight was still taking off so we checked in. Then I remember her saying she was hungry or something, so my brother offered to go get some food. I was going to go with him but he took off ahead of me. I walk out into this section where there are corridors going off in like 5 different directions. I do not know which way he has gone so I just scream STEVE!!!!!!. I wait and then scream STEVE!!!!!! again. FInally I hear him respond. I keep screaming his name until he finds me and then I wake up. Dream 2 I am with 2 girls and we are trying to get to the airport. I remember intially this one girl was driving and we were going down some windy road, then she remembered that she had forgotten something and we had to go back. Then suddenly I am driving and we are once again going down this windy road. Then suddenly the car falls off the road almost as if the road came to an end and went down about 30 feet. So the car goes head first and we hit the pavement. I remember hitting my nose on the ground, as if there was no windshield on the car. It was also a very small car like a VW Bug or something. Everyone had fallen out of the car, one girl had a baby with her but it did not get injured. We picked up the car yes we picked it up LOL and set it up right and got back in. Then I am on my old street where my mom lives. I tell them I am going to run in to see if she can take us to the airport, we were short on time. She opens the door up and we had a very short conversation and she basically said she would not drive us. I distinctly remember saying Well FUCK YOU then! and she replied FUCK YOU TOO and i walked off. LOL That's all I remember, we never did get to the airport though. I have had a lot of dreams over the years dealing with making it to the airport on time, or missing a flight etc, not sure why. I have never missed a flight before, although I have flown quite a bit when i was younger because my dad was a pilot of American Airlines. But in the last 10 years I have only flown about 8. 10 times. Very odd.\n",
      "==========================\n",
      "Ok I remember a lot about this dream. The first part is a bit sketchy. I recall driving down to Florida with 2 friends. I remember that the trip only took us about 6 hours. Which in reality would put me in North Carolina not Florida. I do not remember a ton of specifics however. There was this one part where I saw this girl but I saw her from the perspective of The Sims game as if I was looking down on her and she was this little cartoon person. For some reason I wanted to say hi so I went and rang the door bell, now it was a normal perspective. She opened up and I walked in. Told her I just wanted to introduce myself so we talked for a bit. Next I think I had actually driven back and I was at my mom's house. It was Christmas and some people were going to be coming over. We were waiting on my asshole father as if he wuold really join us and some other man who I supposedly knew. My mom was getting the house ready and stuff, and preparing food, while I was just hanging out. I remember going outside and I walked to the end of the driveway. I was going to go across the and say hi to Mrs. Hadaway, but then it dawned on me that she had died a couple years ago she really did. I could see Mr Hadaway and someone else through the window, but I stopped and went back into the house. I remember suddenly feeling guilty that I had no gift for my dad. Normally I would not care but I guess in the dream I realized he wuold be bringing me a gift and I did not want to have nothing for him. So my mom and I were looking around the house to see what I could give him. She had this wooden sculpture about 1 foot high and we agreed I would give him that. Then I recall noticing that it was about 7pm and I realized that I had left all my Christmas gifts at home. I told my mom I needed to run home to get the gifts. There was a small gift of some type of jewelry for my mom, some HUGE black wooden sculpture of some animal for the un known guy, and of course the small sculpture for my dad was no longer at my mom's house it was at my house. So I told my mom I had to run to my house and to wait for me to get back that I should be back by 8pm. She seemed a little pissed about it. I walked out the door and my dad had just arrived. He was walking towards me and appeared drunk, I gave him a hug and told him I would be back. I hopped in my car and headed to my house. My car was acting really funny, it would not break properly, so I kept running lights. Then suddenly I rear ended someone, and someone else rear ended me. We all pulled over. I saw the guy who hit me walk up and start talking to the other guy. So I pulled my car up closely and suddenly it's in this window of this little toll booth like room. The car had literally gone through the window. I reversed it a bit and got out. Then we all exchange information. The guy I hit gave me his card, I looked at it and read it and found whatever I read to be very interesting and even commented on it, but I cannot remember what it said. Finally I am back on the road and I make it home. Then suddenly I am in Old Towne Alexandria with 2 other friends, Shari from work and someone else. Shari said we had to pick someone up, I was like, look I have to get back home and she went on to tell me where she would be. I said I would swing by but if she was not there I was going home. Then I remember being back at my mom's house and I woke up. I had another dream earlier that involved my mom and we were arguing about something. It was extremely stressful and I was very upset. I cannot recall the arguement but I got so upset that I literally made a groan that was so loud I woke myself up. At which point I was releaved but I still felt quite stressed out about it all.\n",
      "==========================\n",
      "Ok I remember bits and pieces of this dream. Bit 1. I am in my mom's house. Some guy comes over i knew him with some black girl. Everything seems ok but then the black chicks starts walkin through the house going through things. This pissed me off, I was like, What the fuck do you think you're doing? She just kept right on. I was on the phone with my mom and told her I was gonna call the police, the girl heard me but it did not seem to phase her. I think she was in my mom's bedroom by this point. Not sure what happened after that. Bit 2. I am still at my mom's house. It's night time. I look outside and there are 3 cars driving up the street. One slams on his breaks and then the other 2 collide. They were all really big cars like Lincoln Town Cars or something, one was black, not sure what color the others were. Then the people who were in the cars are at my door. I beleive I recognized them as good friends of the family, although I do not remember much else about that. Bit 3. I am at my friend Chyrise's house. We must have been out somewhere together because we were arriving at her door together. She opened the door and her bathroom was straight back although it is not really set up that way. Her husband was standing in the bathroom with a button down shirt and some boxers on, holding his pants. He seemed embarrassed and ran upstairs. Now we are in her house and I remember some white kid being there and that it was her husband's son. The kid had blonde hair. Although her husband is black. The kid had some friend sleeping over as well. At one point in the dream I must have complained that my back hurt and Chyrise gave me this massage thing that I put in the drivers seat of my car to massage my back while I drive.\n"

      "[u\"120 Last night I had kind of an interesting dream. I dreamt that Dad and I were on this car trip and we had the Peavey system that for some reason I had the notion that the Peavey system just kind of like stayed in the car like a thing along the way in case we need it, and it was there and we took it out. We went out in this back woods campsite area and we set up and we were testing it out. And I was mostly, I was standing like about two or three feet away with the wireless microphone and talking while Dad made some adjustments and some checks and some tests at the board. And then I was going to sing something but we really did not have time. We had to pack up and continue on the journey home. And as we were taking down the Peavey system and putting it away, it was getting really dark and we built a campfire. And I dreamt that Dad told me he planned to bring me there for my birthday, and he said, 'I've been checking out your equipment' and I was like, 'Why?' And, 'Well, I want you to have a nice evening,' which I can imagine what that would mean. And I said, 'Well, I would sure like to have the Peavey system along for my birthday thing. ' And, let me see, I think there was something else. Oh, then we were in the car on the way home and we were coming around the alley, we were going to pull in the back.\", u'124 Last night I had kind of a strange dream. I dreamt that we were going to this party with the fire people, and we were driving along in the car, which for some reason our car had a siren. Anyway, we were driving along and I was supposed to call some chief on the radio and tell him we were going to be a little late, and so I did. And it started out as a professional, short transmission, but then it turned into a long. winded friendly, teasing thing. And I never did get to the party. I do not know any more. It was kind of dumb.', u\"Ok I had a continuation of the dream from the night before. That so rarely happens to me. I rarely even have recurring dreams. Similar themes sometimes but not usually the same type of dream. In this one I am once again in australia and we are once again in the water right off the shore from what looks to be Sydney Australia. It's me and a friend I used to know back in the day named Linda. We were on this floaty type thing zippin through the water. I was hanging off it so most of my body was actually in the water. I could feel things touching my legs as we zipped around, I assumed it was seaweed. Then I am in the car with my aunt and we are driving around. I told her to check out the skyline suddenly I get the feeling we are in Hawaii now even though I refer to Sydney. She looks over to the left where the airport is but there is a lot of fog. I tell her to just wait a sec, and the fog lifts and we could see the city it was really cool looking. That's all I remember.\", u\"154 I had kind of a dumb dream last night. I dreamt that we had bought an SUV like minivan. like type thing, and it had this multi. band receiver that was like a scanner thing that could also receive FM signals. And I was like, 'Whoopee, wow, look at this,' and I was sitting there trying to figure it out while we're on the way over. tape slips What is wrong with this tape? Anyway, we were on the way to the fire station, and when we got there, it stopped for a minute. I do not know why it did that. But anyway, we got over there and I was like walking in this boardwalk and Dad was showing and talking to his buddies and showing them this, and by that time it had turned into the green truck that we have now, and he was going to start the engine and show how good this sound system sounded and stuff. And he started the engine and it would not start. Uh oh, it was a rotten egg.\", u'155 Last night I dreamt that both the house and the car had just gotten an alarm because somebody was paranoid about burglars breaking in. Well, after that I was paranoid about the thing going off. First of all, in the car we were kind of afraid to turn on the radio, we were afraid to move or anything, and because, you know how that goes, and there was a little click when it turns on and another little click when it turned off, and we were not really sure exactly which was which. And in the house I was afraid for people to come to the door and ring the doorbell, and so on and so forth. And I dreamt that I was going to stay up late and bake cookies for Mike and Chelsea, and then they come over, which is even better, and then they come in and fortunately the alarm does not go off. And we roll out the dough and I start cutting out cookies, and then I fade into consciousness.', u\"Ok I am sure I will screw up the order of this dream because i do not quite remember what happened when. First I remember being with some girls, I believe one was my best friend Chyrise. We were going to fly to california. Ca not remember why but it was to put on some type of show somewhere. I remember we got the tickets and our flight. We were driving in the car and a guy named Richard came up and handed us 3 tickets that would get us to cali and back for 213, gotta like that. I go home to get ready and I first need to make sure my cats will have enough food. They have a self feeder and self waterer that you can fill up for days at a time. So I go to check their food and notice some of the food is in the water dish so I clean that out. Then I notice that in their food dish there are a bunch of MMs all kinds of colors so yes it was in color. Their cat food was quite colorful too. So I cleaned out all the MMs thinking the cats shouldnt eat chocolate. Then I remember seeing some bugs on the ground and as I looked around the house i kept seeing more. Then I am freaking out cuz i think i cannot go to california with all these bugs in my house i will come back and they will have taken OVER. So my friend Chyrise stops by and I tell her I cannot go. Then she helps me track down how these bugs may be getting into the house. We look at the window and see that it's wide open with no screen. AHH There is the culprit. Then suddenly all these bugs appear 2 of them are like giant palmetto bugs big roaches except they were like 1 12 FEET long. oh my god they were so big. I also saw some bugs I have never personally seen before, they were all marching towards the window as if to leave. We now are in my car except some guy is with me. I look in my rear view mirror and an undercover cop has his lights on and is pulling us over. It was a big white lincoln or so it seemed. I knew I did not have my COUNTRY sticker yet because it's a new car and I have procrastinated. So I knew i was going to get nailed. I also had some POT in my purse so got all nervous about that. Well suddenly we are no longer on the side of the road but in some parking lot. The cop comes over and says he is going to check out to make sure the car was not stolen. So while we are waiting we get out of the car and talk with some other people that are there. Finally the cop lets me go, no harm done. That's all I remember. police\", u\"Oh god this dream was all over the place. First I remember being at my mom's house but do not remember that much about it. Then I remember I was no longer at her house and wanted to call her. I pulled out my cell phone and tried to dial her number. I could not seem to get through. Finally I got through but it was as if she could not hear me we were not able to have a conversation. Although in the dream I felt like she was deliberately ignoring me and it got me upset. So I tried calling her back and could not get the number right. When I looked at the number I dialed I remember seeing 642 something. when in fact her number is 451. etc. This was a CLEAR dream sign yet I was not able to figure out I was dreaming. grrrrr. Next I am in the airport with my old friend Tammy and someone else. As we are walking through the airport I remember these 2 black people were getting tarred and feathered. You heard right. I felt very disturbed at what I saw, I did not think it was right. Next thing I know I have a coat of tar on my arms and legs. I am basically walking around the airport and my arms and legs have this thing coat of black tar on them. I figured once it dried I could get it off. Then I start to pull it off my arm and it was coming off as if it were Liquid latex, for those who know what that is. So I am rolling this tar off my arm and remember seeing the hair coming off with it, however it did not hurt at all. Then I started on my legs, I do not remember getting it all off but I must have. Next there was this scene where a car had gotten flooded and my purse with our tickets and stuff were in the car, someone got in the car to retrieve my stuff. I remember being very upset because some photos that were in my purse were destroyed. Finally we realize we are gonna mis the plane. We found one of the guys that drives old people around in the airport and ask him to give us a ride to the gate. He gives us a ride to the escalator and tells us to go down that the gate would be there. We get down there and there is one gate but it's not the one we needed. We were looking for E3 or G3 cannot remember. Some guy told us it was one way, then another guy said no it's that way, leading us down some dark hallway, I remember feeling very uncomfortable. Then suddenly I am in my house. I remember hearing this loud noise coming from across the hall, I looked through the peep hole and saw that my neighbors were having some party, there were all these people in their living room. Then I remember someone opening my front door, I stood in front of it so they could not open it all the way, it freaked me out cuz the door is locked. I peek out and see my brother. He looks like he had been rolling around in dirt or something LOL he was quite dirty. I immediately started crying. he is dead in real life this is typical i tend to cry when i am reunited with him He asked if he could come in, I was hesitant cuz my condo was messy LOL but I told him he could, he walked in and some guy came in behind him. I was like No only you. so he had to wait out in the hall. That's all I remember.\", u\"167 Last night I had kind of an odd dream. First I dreamt that Dad was doing some kind of remodeling up here, and I not only had a fan with black blades, but I had this air conditioner that was mounted in the ceiling and I was going to control it on the wall with the fan switches. And so I remember I did not know how to shut off the air conditioner and I was ice cold, and I was going to tell Mom to come shut it off. And I dreamt that in Mom's room, she had this rack CD player that was like a box machine that goes with system stuff. And it was kind of silvery and it had a little design in the front. And I was trying to figure how she worked it and stuff. And it was not connected to any amplifiers or anything, so I do not know how she got sound out of it, but I remember it was pretty, kind of neat, and I was thinking, oh, she could finally play CD's and maybe she'll start getting rid of her tapes. And then I dreamt that Mom had a tape of the X Files that I made a CD of so she was getting rid of that tape, and I was thinking of saving it so I could recycle it, but I said naaah. Next I had another little dream, after I figured, I dreamt that I was so ice cold in my dream because the fan was making me cold, so I got up and turned it off. And I went back to sleep and dreamt I was at this fair thing with Mom, and there were these kids over in this one booth that she was watching while their mother went to go do something, and while we were in the bathroom, Mom told me she knew some stuff about Celine Dion, like her address and her phone number, but did not want to tell any of us, and I guess because I knew who her baby doctor was, because she blabbed it all over TV. And what do they call that  obstetrician? Mother for the woman; for the baby it's pediatrician. But I mean when the baby's pregnant. Mother no, when the mother's pregnant with the baby. Mother you mean the mother's going to have the baby, not the baby's going to have the mother. That's the obstetrician. Yeah, that's what I mean! Anyway, the obstetrician is Dr. Rosenwax  she blabbed it all over TV. But anyway, so there were these ducks and these geese hanging out by these kids and they were so tame. And I was over at another booth doing something, and I was crawling over to the booth where Mom is because there were these air vent gratings in this tent thing, and I was crawling on this tent material over to where Mom was. And then I was just sitting down doing nothing, and I had my mini. disc recorder for WMNF, but I did not have the personal CD player. Next thing I knew I was riding home in the car with Tim Dil Peterson, and he was talking to me about editing and stuff, and about  I forgot my personal CD player, but I could have transferred some songs to the mini disc player so I could have one thing to do both jobs. And then I woke up.\", u\"169 Last night, let's see, I had this terrible dream. I dreamt that I was watching this documentary that I had taped on TV, like this news program or something, and it was Celine Dion at her computer going through some MIDI files on her website and Rene Charles, her baby, was on her lap, and she was explaining to the viewing audience which songs that Rene liked and which ones made him nervous and put him on edge, and which ones he liked. And then as the story went along, it showed him in this, Rene and this car and him getting in this major fiery accident. And sigh then it showed him like three or four all of a sudden, trying to fight somebody and somebody was trying to attack him as the ambulance was coming. And he was like, 'I'm three years old and I know how to use a knife. I can take a sparkler and I can burn you. ' And I do not remember exactly what happened. I was like rewinding the tape and it was like playing it over and over again, and that was weird. And then the phone rang and woke me up.\", u\"173 Last night I had a dream, like Martin Luther King. Well, I'm expecting a surprise visit from my sister Sandra tomorrow, but I do not know what in the world or when in the world because they will not tell me. So anyway, I had this dream that Sandra was here and I was telling her the story of we set up the keyboard on the kitchen counter, of all things, and it was white, the body was white and it was twice the size. I put my two hands on it. There was enough span for the bass clef and the treble clef, and I started playing the accompaniment for Easy Like Sunday morning. And Sandra was like, 'Wow, girl!' And Dad was out in the yard and he could hear it, and then here comes the really bizarre part. We were getting ready to go to this thing at the city Performing Arts Center and Sandra and Dad wanted to go with us, but I guess they were not ready. I was just like in the car in the passenger seat, and the car was just going where I needed it to go. And it was just going on the interstate, 70 mph and it got off the exit at the right exit, and the only problem I had that it needed to be driven was when it came time to park, and since I was not steering it, it parked kind of cockeyed across three other spaces. And it was twirling around a little tiny bit. And I shut off the ignition just in time before it crashed into something. And oh, when I was on the interstate, I could see around me, everybody in the truck behind me. I could see Mom and Sandra in the truck behind me, and so when I got parked, shortly after that Mom pulled up in the truck. And I had to tell her how cockeyed the car parked, and Sandra was there and I did not want Dad to know that I 'drove' even though I did not drive all by myself. And we were going to race home and get him, but we decided, 'Nah,' and I do not remember too much after that, but I do remember that we were all at this like camp fire celebration with these fireworks going off later on. And then I woke up.\", u'Ok i remember just one part of this dream. We are leaving to go somewhere and we are in the car. I do not remember who i was with but get the feeling it was my family. As we come to this bridge which looks like it has a toll i remember i forgot something at home. So we have to turn around. Here is the wild part. I am sitting in the car looking ahead and the bridge goes STRAIGHT up to the point where it is SO steep it looks like a rollercoaster hill. i see cars going up it though, although in real life there is no way cars could get up this steep hill. we drive up this huge hill and i am freaking out thinking we are going to fall, we get to the first toll and turn around. well now we have to go over the huge hill yet again. This time its not like a hill but its like a draw bridge where part of the road is lifted straight up. So we ride up but are going too slow so reverse back down. Then we pick up speed and ride up it again when we get to the top we have to go over about a 1 foot section before coming back down the other side. I dont know how we made it but we did. Thats all i remember. It was freaky.', u\"093 I am driving a jeep in the country. The land is green and dotted with old wooden houses. I park near Doug C. and his friend. We begin talking. I hear chopper blades and look up. A Huey with red cross markings prepares to land close by. I say to Doug, 'Oh God, it's a Medevac. ' Then I am in a bar crowded with soldiers. I recognize several men, though I mistake one man for someone else. I take a long swig from a bottle. I am crying. I want the men to see this. I want the man mistaken for someone else to see this.\", u\"190 Last night I had kind of a dumb dream. I dreamt that we were at Fort Washington and Mom was saying last time we were here we had a big fight. And I was swimming around and it was getting gray, and I came back to them and they said there is distressing news in the air, there is distressing news. And, of course, I thought that my distress was finally known to them. And it was really that there was a storm coming, and so because there was a storm coming, we headed home. And I had the notion that we were driving Grandpa and Carl and Arlene in our car, which we went to lunch with them yesterday, so that's probably it. But we only drove Grandpa. And we dropped Grandpa off at his house, but then we brought Carl and Arlene home. I ran in and we had this porch that was not screened in, and it was like one of those laundry room porch things that had all kinds of junk on it and I had the notion that my room was on this porch. My bed was there, a bunch of my stuff was there, I had a dresser there, and on top of that dresser the keyboard was still sitting on top of that dresser. And I had a mixer of the same design, with the same red faders, and kind of funky LED display and kind of funky design. I had a mixer the exact design, and they like went together like a set, and they were both sitting on top of my dresser. And I knew that Carl and Arlene were going to come in, so I put a towel over them so they would not see them. And I do not remember too much more. Let me think a minute. And, oh yeah, in my dream they both worked, but before Carl and Arlene were supposed to come in, for some reason I ran in the house. The system was on to sound like people were home. I ran in the house and turned it up a little and then I came back outside to see Carl and Arlene. And it was like you could hear it out there. It was like I ran in and turned it on. I do not know how meaningful that is, but it certainly is interesting.\", u\"194 Finally over with this crazy month. Last night I dreamt that we were at Ginnie Springs and that we were getting ready to go swimming. And we were at the springs and I realized that I was still fully dressed and I forgot my bathing suit. So I like went back to the camp site, or I thought I was going back to the camp site to get it, but I could not find my way back and I came back several times to ask for directions. And then I finally realized that my time's getting short and it's really not important whether or not I had my bathing suit. So I ripped off my clothes and went in skinny dipping. And that would have been just fine if there were not three or four rappy boys standing around with a personal CD player and stuff. But in my dream I did not care, and just jumped in. And then I think I swam around for a little while. It was pretty shallow. And then we got out of the water and we went, we got back in the car, and then I think the kids suddenly appeared. They were not there before, but they like suddenly appeared. And we were going to some hotel, and I was thinking how, what a shame it was that the radio got shut off and there was a really good song on. And then I had the notion that I was looking at Sound and Vision in the back seat of the car. And then I remember, as I was slowly fading into consciousness, that I had the notion that the radio on my nightstand was on and it was playing the same song. And that I did not need to worry about it being shut off in the car. But when I actually woke up and regained full consciousness, of course, it was not on. It was not like the alarm was on and it turned on or anything. It was just in my dream, I thought it was. Well, I do not know, that was an okay dream. I keep having dreams about Ginnie Springs; I wonder what that could mean.\", u\"I do not remember a ton of this dream I do remember I hurt my wrist in the dream and then it was throbbing in pain. I would feel the pain quite vividly. I was telling my friends I thought it was broken. Then I remember another portion where I got in my car and I drove out into the street and another car was driving down the street and could not stop. I remember looking up at the driver in that car and he just looked at me and shrugged as if there was nothing he could do, as if we would have time for all that. And then he hit me but not too hard, right on the drivers side. That's all I remember other then waking up and realizing I had twisted my wrist all up and it was throbbing in pain and asleep. So basically the pain incorporated it's way into my dream. Fun Fun!\", u\"197 You know what, guys? This is a horrible tape, and I should know never to use it again. It's getting old and it goes, 'Squeeeeeeeeeeeeeeak!' And it's got these little breaking up on the cell phone type of sounds when you play it back, so I'm never using this horrible tape ever again. Let's have a go. For a simple mono voice track, one voice up close that does not really record a whole lot, yes I will use this horrible tape. And some  I do not know  I used to think it was years, but now it's like a couple of months down the road I might be able to rip all my dreams to MP3 files and put four or five tapes on one disc, because I do not have to worry about the big long explanation, I'll explain it later. Space is of a premium here. I had quite a dream last night. I dreamt that Mrs. Dougherty and I were in the little theater and first we were just standing and talking, and then we were sitting down in chairs next to each other. And next I was sitting on her lap, like Mom and I sit sometimes when she says, 'You big baby. ' And we were talking about like how the altos have the tendency to want to be more riled up and more street. like than the sopranos do. And then we were in the auditorium, and I was standing up on the stage and watching all of them coming up on the stage, and it was real clear this morning  the rest of it. But the tape rain out and I did not have enough room and I was going to do it on another tape but I did not have time in the morning; it was like 800 o'clock already. But now it's all kind of like vague and foggy. I should have put it on first thing, as soon as I woke up. The bit I do remember is that we were supposed to, we were gearing up to go to this Sweet Adeline's workshop and next thing I know, Dad and I are in the car and Mom's riding her bike alongside, and then I woke up.\", u\"205 Last night I had kind of a whacky dream. I dreamt that we were going camping and we were in the car and we were going all around these different trails and stuff. And then Mom and Dad were going to get out and scout around for a little while, so they left the ignition on; and, I mean, they shut the engine but they left the radio on that is with the ignition. And so they went out scouting around. Well, for some reason the seat came out of the car and was like rolling along on the road, and it turned into like a swing, and I would be able to like fly along the road because of it. And Mom came by and said that at somebody's campsite they had a sound booth, and they were going to play songs on the sound system pretty soon. And I heard a song played and Mom was going to take me over to see the sound booth, but I do not know, something happened. And then Mom came into the room and kind of woke me up. And then I went back to sleep and had another dream, that, well, maybe this was like a continuation of that one, I do not know. I was at Sunset Grill with my equipment, and instead of Suzy Barton being there, there were these three or four boys that were kind of rough. And I had the Peavey system set up and I had the CD writer set up. I was going to burn some CD's. And I was up on the stage and in back of the stage there was this wall where I had a few shelves where I put some equipment. And the boys were on stage announcing and I was sitting back there with my, I was facing the wall, facing the equipment. And I turned on my microphone and it made feedback, and somehow I had the notion that it was because I had two CD writers  one was mine that I use and one was this white one. And I dreamt that this white one had faulty circuitry, and it was letting signals through that were causing feedback. Now how whacked out is that! Oh, and the plot thickens! So I gave that white CD writer to the boys, and in exchange they gave me this personal CD tape player and they gave me a Spice Girl's tape . And so we got home and Dad and I are working on DP, and this personal CD tape player is kind of unique in that it's like an interface with DP. That's bizarre! Well, I guess not really; it was like, it was not really too bizarre, I guess. And we were playing the Spice Girls tape and I wanted to put it on an audio CD, and we were running it through DP to kind of clean it up some. And then in the middle of that I faded into consciousness, like I drew a cross .\", u\"215 Last night I had a dream that Ms. S and I were going to a pool party, and that they were swimming around and swimming around in the pool. I was kind of trying not to touch the bottom with my feet, thinking there was a pool cleaner roaming around, which a lot of time is what I do anyway. I try to grab the side because I do not want to reach down and find anything buried down there. So then we got out and we were walking around the side and there was this kids' slide that had stairs leading up to it, and then the person would like slide through the puddle and then out and down the slide. And there was this pail of plastic potato chips that really smelled real with a shovel and a couple other play things that kids could play with. And then I went inside this like club. like type place and the lady said that she does birthday parties and things, and I gave her my card and said, 'Call me if you ever need a DJ. ' And then I dreamt that I was home and Mom was telling me this big secret, that there was something that she had that was really secret and not to ever use it until her and Dad went out of town. But I do not remember what it was, but it was something small and electronic like a camera or a cell phone, or maybe she was referring to the mini disc recorder, I do not know. But then her and I were dancing around in the living room because we were so happy about something; I do not remember what. And let's see, and then when Mom and Dad came back from being out of town, Mom confided in me that the car had automatic horns, whatever that is! And that would mean that whenever somebody's singing in the car and they hold a long chromate at the end, the horn will start honking after you're through! That was crazy, man!\", u\"216 Last night I had a dream that Mom and Dad went out for the evening and I had some things to do while they were out. First of all I was putting some CD's in the CD player and I was going to dance and stuff like I usually do. Then I had this notion that I had to go out to get something; I do not remember where it was or what I had to do, but I had to go somewhere. So I got in the car, I started it up and I sat in the back seat, and it just took off from there and it just sort of knew where I wanted to go. And it stopped and it parked itself in the parking lot when we got there. Like I said, I do not remember what it was, but I remember getting out and talking to somebody in the parking lot and being real afraid because I do not look like I'm of age to drive. Then by the time it was time for me to come home, it was dark and I was really afraid because I was going to crash somewhere. And again, I started it up and I sat in the big seat with this  thing, and it just sort of knew when to stop at this traffic light and knew where to turn  that was so crazy! But when we got to Allison's, we were almost home and we were coming down 5th Street, and we were at Allison's and it just sort of stopped in front of her house. And Megan came up to me and started asking questions and I did not want to start it up and move it home because Megan was right there and she would think it's funny. And so after talking to Megan, I just walked home and I put the boom box out on the front lawn and played some CD's and I sat in the green chair. And then I woke up.\", u'219 Last night I dreamt Dad was kind of in some kind of a snit, which he really is, and we were driving along, driving on a trip doing something. And there was like this smooth jazz concert going on in the park and we thought if we stopped and we laid down a picnic and all, that would be good. And so we stopped the car and we got out, and we went over, we started walking around and they, this guy was giving out big candy trunks, candy bar. like trunks in this box, and I took a big chocolate one. It was just kind of like the size of a rock. And I took a bit of it, and before I knew it, it turned into like a chocolate walking stick, so I was walking around with it. And then Dad thought that would be too dangerous, so he took it. And we walked around the park and we were listening to the songs, and Mom was kind of miffed because he did not sit down and pay attention to her. He was walking around and listening to the concert with me. And then I just remembered something else. Before all this, there was another part of the dream, that we were at my high school and Mrs. Dougherty was holding a Christmas concert in the little theater. And we were invited and her chorus was going to put it on. And I was thinking that I would finally hear something from her chorus. Well, it turned out that they were not ready and they did not put it on. That was kind of a bummer. And then I woke up.', u\"Going to post these together since they happened the same night and had a common theme, although were completely different. Dream1 First dream I only remember a small part. I am at the airport with my brother who is dead in RL and some other person. We are flying back to Washington. We get to the gate to check in and on the board I do not see the flight for DCA. So I remember getting a bit stressed thinking the flight had been cancelled for something. Then the lady told us the flight was still taking off so we checked in. Then I remember her saying she was hungry or something, so my brother offered to go get some food. I was going to go with him but he took off ahead of me. I walk out into this section where there are corridors going off in like 5 different directions. I do not know which way he has gone so I just scream STEVE!!!!!!. I wait and then scream STEVE!!!!!! again. FInally I hear him respond. I keep screaming his name until he finds me and then I wake up. Dream 2 I am with 2 girls and we are trying to get to the airport. I remember intially this one girl was driving and we were going down some windy road, then she remembered that she had forgotten something and we had to go back. Then suddenly I am driving and we are once again going down this windy road. Then suddenly the car falls off the road almost as if the road came to an end and went down about 30 feet. So the car goes head first and we hit the pavement. I remember hitting my nose on the ground, as if there was no windshield on the car. It was also a very small car like a VW Bug or something. Everyone had fallen out of the car, one girl had a baby with her but it did not get injured. We picked up the car yes we picked it up LOL and set it up right and got back in. Then I am on my old street where my mom lives. I tell them I am going to run in to see if she can take us to the airport, we were short on time. She opens the door up and we had a very short conversation and she basically said she would not drive us. I distinctly remember saying Well FUCK YOU then! and she replied FUCK YOU TOO and i walked off. LOL That's all I remember, we never did get to the airport though. I have had a lot of dreams over the years dealing with making it to the airport on time, or missing a flight etc, not sure why. I have never missed a flight before, although I have flown quite a bit when i was younger because my dad was a pilot of American Airlines. But in the last 10 years I have only flown about 8. 10 times. Very odd.\", u\"Ok I remember a lot about this dream. The first part is a bit sketchy. I recall driving down to Florida with 2 friends. I remember that the trip only took us about 6 hours. Which in reality would put me in North Carolina not Florida. I do not remember a ton of specifics however. There was this one part where I saw this girl but I saw her from the perspective of The Sims game as if I was looking down on her and she was this little cartoon person. For some reason I wanted to say hi so I went and rang the door bell, now it was a normal perspective. She opened up and I walked in. Told her I just wanted to introduce myself so we talked for a bit. Next I think I had actually driven back and I was at my mom's house. It was Christmas and some people were going to be coming over. We were waiting on my asshole father as if he wuold really join us and some other man who I supposedly knew. My mom was getting the house ready and stuff, and preparing food, while I was just hanging out. I remember going outside and I walked to the end of the driveway. I was going to go across the and say hi to Mrs. Hadaway, but then it dawned on me that she had died a couple years ago she really did. I could see Mr Hadaway and someone else through the window, but I stopped and went back into the house. I remember suddenly feeling guilty that I had no gift for my dad. Normally I would not care but I guess in the dream I realized he wuold be bringing me a gift and I did not want to have nothing for him. So my mom and I were looking around the house to see what I could give him. She had this wooden sculpture about 1 foot high and we agreed I would give him that. Then I recall noticing that it was about 7pm and I realized that I had left all my Christmas gifts at home. I told my mom I needed to run home to get the gifts. There was a small gift of some type of jewelry for my mom, some HUGE black wooden sculpture of some animal for the un known guy, and of course the small sculpture for my dad was no longer at my mom's house it was at my house. So I told my mom I had to run to my house and to wait for me to get back that I should be back by 8pm. She seemed a little pissed about it. I walked out the door and my dad had just arrived. He was walking towards me and appeared drunk, I gave him a hug and told him I would be back. I hopped in my car and headed to my house. My car was acting really funny, it would not break properly, so I kept running lights. Then suddenly I rear ended someone, and someone else rear ended me. We all pulled over. I saw the guy who hit me walk up and start talking to the other guy. So I pulled my car up closely and suddenly it's in this window of this little toll booth like room. The car had literally gone through the window. I reversed it a bit and got out. Then we all exchange information. The guy I hit gave me his card, I looked at it and read it and found whatever I read to be very interesting and even commented on it, but I cannot remember what it said. Finally I am back on the road and I make it home. Then suddenly I am in Old Towne Alexandria with 2 other friends, Shari from work and someone else. Shari said we had to pick someone up, I was like, look I have to get back home and she went on to tell me where she would be. I said I would swing by but if she was not there I was going home. Then I remember being back at my mom's house and I woke up. I had another dream earlier that involved my mom and we were arguing about something. It was extremely stressful and I was very upset. I cannot recall the arguement but I got so upset that I literally made a groan that was so loud I woke myself up. At which point I was releaved but I still felt quite stressed out about it all.\", u'I am walking to a store and I see a small crowd of people and see 2 cats up on the roof. I get a better look and one is a kitten persian and one is a larger cat. The kitten looks similar to my old cat Roscoe. They were trying to figure out how they were going to get them down. The kitten actually belonged to a lady who owned the pet store down the street, the other cat belonged to someone else. Then this one couple walked by and I over heard them saying that they could hear the cats meowing a few miles away. I walk off and start heading towards another store. I see some guys putting boxes in there so I walk in and see all these t. shirts. I start going through them and taking the ones I like that I find in my size. One had this very cool design on it depicting the sun. I go into another store which looks like a bedroom there is all this stuff there that is mine and I need to take it back to the house and pack it. There are 2 guys there with me and I ask them to help me collect this stuff and bring it back. So we are all picking up the clothes and stuff. I see several pair of shoes and decide not to take them because they are all ugly and I would never wear them. As we are leaving the roomstore there is one final pair of shoes on the night table. They look like berkenstock sp? sandals but when i turn them over the strap is really weird looking, and I laugh thinking that i would never wear them. We leave the store and get back to the house. There is some type of quiz show going on downstairs. We stop and decide to participate. The first 2 questions I am unable to answer so I am like fuck it and head upstairs. As I get upstairs this guy is sliding down the stairs and runs into me. He looks high, I attempt to get around him. Suddenly I am the guy and this black lady is coming up the stairs saying she needs to give me a drug test. She hands me this pill that i am supposed to suck on and I guess if it changes colors it means I am high. I suck it and give it back to her and it had changed colors. I am in observation mode now and see the guy who was high and another woman walking next to a horse who is being ridden by a little girl. The woman looks a little disturbed that the high guy is there. Still in observation mode I switch scenes and there are 2 people on this small bus and they are heading to the house I am in. The are arguing about something. The wife seems to have the upper hand in the arguement and then the husband says something that seems to make the wife feel really guilty, it was a real low blow it seems in order to get the upper hand, she seemed upset. Then suddenly I am the woman and we pass Hugh Grant wearing a purple suit and walking down the street with a suitcase towards the house. I remember thinking that he did not have enough money to take a cab from the town to the house. I ask the bus driver to pull over and pick him up. I am back in the house and I look out the window and I see some kids running as if they were running a marathon. Then I am in observation mode again. I am looking at 3 people driving in a car, towards the house. Jennifer Lopez is sitting in the back its as if she was the one who needed a ride and she is holding a huge plant. She looks very pretty and has on some sunglasses and was just sitting there quietly, I observed her for a few minutes. Back in the house again I look out another window and still see these kids running, one of them looks up at me. Then everyone is downstairs and Hugh Grant explains that the plant was not actually for Jennifer even though she is the one that brought it that it was for. and I woke up. At one point in the last dream I remember seeing this diagram. It was a picture of the sun and then a line extended from that sun to another sun. Then another line extended and there was a circle with a triangle inside. I heard someone describing the diagram as it began to move. The 2 suns were rotating around eachother in the circle but kind of in a triangular pattern. Weird.', u\"Here are the parts i remember. At one point I am at my old house where I grew up. I am walking up to the shopping center where someone is supposed to pick me up. It was night time. As I was walking I ran into this man. He pointed to a building down the street and said something to the effect that it was going to be demolished and I better leave. Then I saw something that said it would affect anyone within a 11 mile radius. Next I am with some people in a car we are driving to a night club I beleive. I do not think we ever got to the club. Then I am in some house and some people are sleeping. We go out and start going to these stores. I was looking for a store that sold rare books and other rare items. I got to this one store and this older man come up to me. I told him I was looking for rare items and then pointed out my nose ring to him and told him I got it at another shop that sold rare items. The walked me over to a desk and opened the drawer and pulled out this peach colored nose stud. I looked at it and it was way to wide to fit me. Then he proceeded to show me how to wear it, it was as if it snapped over the one I already had on. He said that you did not even have to have your nose pierced to wear it. I am back at this house and I woke up one person saying we should all go to breakfast. Then we are at some diner and people are ordering things. One guy ordered some cheese sticks or something. I reminded everyone not to eat much since we were going out to breakfast. LOL Then we left the diner and went somewhere else. Not sure where we were exactly, but it was outside and there were a lot of people walking around. I remember there was this big grassy hill. Then I see a cop and think to myself that they must be coming for me because i left the diner without paying. And of course the cop and one other guy walked up saying I had not paid. I was like Oh my god I am so sorry I did not mean to leave without paying and paid them what I owed. That's all I really remember. I know there was another part of the dream that consisted of the beach but cannot remember specifics.\", u\"097 I am at a dance with an attractive woman who has promised me a place to live. Our friendship is platonic. Afterwards we walk down a snowy moonlit street. We are happy and young. She puts her arm around my shoulder. 'I like you,' she says. 'I really like you. ' Then we sit in her car and neck. Our kisses are sensual, giving, tender. She removes her blouse and straddles me. Outside, a small wood sign is tacked to a street lamp. Its handwritten letters state, 'Kit Karson Scouts. ' I raise up and embrace her. 'That's gold,' I say. 'Absolute gold. ' Then we make love.\", u\"OK I was at my mom's once again. I was sleeping in the guest bedroom because someone was visiting and sleeping in my room. I woke up and went down stairs. There were all these people in our house. I walked into the living room and there was this young guy probably around 18 or so with brown hair sitting int he living room. It appears I knew him and it also appeared that I liked him or had a crush on him. I sit down on the floor and start talking and then I realize I only have on my tshirt and underwear and get embarrassed. I leave and go back upstairs to get dressed. I go into the bathroom to take a shower. When I am in there my cat Roscoe who I no longer have walks in to the bathroom. He is a copper colored persian with really long hair. Anyway, he was shaved completely except for the hair on his head and tail. this happened once in real life his fur got all matted and we had to get him shaved. So I was like Who the fuck shaved my cat?. I walked out into the hall trying to find the culprit. And someone said Buddy was shaved too. Buddy is another cat I used to have. I seemed annoyed but did not pursue it. I finally took a shower and then after the shower I was trying on this hat and it looked really cute. Then I go into my bedroom to get dressed and I see the visitors suitcase on my bed. It was a black suitcase with a red stripe. Then, I cannot find the hat that I was just wearing. It was a red and black hat. I start going through things in my room and cannot find it. I go into the guest room which is extremely cluttered and start looking through things. I find 2 hats that are very similar but not the right one. One of them I put on and it's way too big and covers my eyes. Then I finally find the hat. It was red with a black adidas logo on it. I want some earrings to match so I go back to my room, the visitors suitcase is now closed and on the floor. I go over to a drawer where I kept all my earrings. I start going through everything, there was a lot of really cool looking jewelry in the drawer. Finally I find 2 pair of red earrings but one is broken and the other is missing a back so I cannot wear either, I was frustrated. Then suddenly I look at my nose and it appears my nose ring is missing. I get quite frantic because it's very small, wondering where the hell it could be. I do not find it. Next I am getting into the car with my best friend Chyrise. We have to go to the mall. We get there and go inside for something do not remember what. When we are coming out of the mall to leave we see this one area roped off by the police with that yellow police tape. My friend Chyrise walks right through the tape and starts walking up this huge paved hill. The cop runs after her asking what she is doing. THen I was like Chyrise where is the car? She says it's on the level I am on. So I am thinking well why the hell is she going up that hill then?. I remember going back home but that's about it.\", u\"Ok I remember bits and pieces of this dream. Bit 1. I am in my mom's house. Some guy comes over i knew him with some black girl. Everything seems ok but then the black chicks starts walkin through the house going through things. This pissed me off, I was like, What the fuck do you think you're doing? She just kept right on. I was on the phone with my mom and told her I was gonna call the police, the girl heard me but it did not seem to phase her. I think she was in my mom's bedroom by this point. Not sure what happened after that. Bit 2. I am still at my mom's house. It's night time. I look outside and there are 3 cars driving up the street. One slams on his breaks and then the other 2 collide. They were all really big cars like Lincoln Town Cars or something, one was black, not sure what color the others were. Then the people who were in the cars are at my door. I beleive I recognized them as good friends of the family, although I do not remember much else about that. Bit 3. I am at my friend Chyrise's house. We must have been out somewhere together because we were arriving at her door together. She opened the door and her bathroom was straight back although it is not really set up that way. Her husband was standing in the bathroom with a button down shirt and some boxers on, holding his pants. He seemed embarrassed and ran upstairs. Now we are in her house and I remember some white kid being there and that it was her husband's son. The kid had blonde hair. Although her husband is black. The kid had some friend sleeping over as well. At one point in the dream I must have complained that my back hurt and Chyrise gave me this massage thing that I put in the drivers seat of my car to massage my back while I drive.\", u'This dream was actually quite long but of course i only remember a few pieces. The dream actually took place over several days because I remember going to sleep for the night on at least 2 occasions in the dream. We were at a hotel I believe, possibly at some conference or convention. My good friend Mike was there but I do not know if we were rooming together. I remember at one point in the dream I felt jealous about some other female that wanted to get to know Mike. At one point towards the end of our stay I suggested we all skip the conference and go down to the beach. Everyone seemed to agree. I was looking for something to wear but cannot remember details about it. Then I was talking to some guy about where we would go and where we would park. At that point I believe I thought we were at Virginia Beach. We discussed how we could park a block or 2 from the main intersection. As we discussed that I actually could see the busy intersection with cars etc and saw the spot where we would park. It was as if I was looking at the scene overhead. There was a lot more to this dream but it seems to have faded away.', u\"I was in a parking lot, and was walking to my car. There was a car next to me with a guy putting stuff in the trunk. As I got closer I realized he was some celebrity no idea who he was a white guy, with curly brown hair, probably in his 40's. It appeared he was putting golf clubs in his trunk. So I walk up to my trunk and open it and then I put down this bag, I must have been carrying. I opened it and took my golf clubs i dont play golf out and put them in the trunk. This caused him to say something to me and we started talking. I ended up going for a ride with him. Now his car is suddenly this weird looking thing. It was really long and narrow and had no top. I could hardly fit into it. Then we arrive at some place where he was going to visit his daughter. There is a small concrete wall about 4 feet high. There were visitors on one side of the wall and the the people they were visiting on the other side. I think it was rehab or something. I got the impression they were mistreating the people inside. I remember this blonde girl coming up and talking to us. Then for some reason I got the impression that this was my long lost father the actor. That's all I remember.\"]\n"
