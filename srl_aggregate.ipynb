       "'020 I am with my old unit in Vietnam. The order comes over the radio that we are now finished with jungle patrols. The Lieutenant makes it official and we silently begin to disband. Suddenly, a civilian, an older man in a suit, emerges from a tent. He speaks to us. \"If my son can\\'t go, no one goes.\" Then he shoots and kills my good friend Jerry Bieck. I am overwhelmed and unload several shots at him. Nothing happens. Then, with an unusually long burst of automatic from my M-16 I cut him down. As the others have walked off, I throw the gun down and follow after them. There is a feeling of complete freedom. In very high spirits Jim Lamb and I go to a supermarket and buy food. I am aware that I do not wear my steel helmet. The dream is repeated. This time I do the killing with a laser beam. The man is this time Parrish, a medic from another company I did not like. He dies a slow and agonizing death.'"

      "I was in a parlor and I had been kidnapped by a man like the man in the show last night, and some other man too. The house looked like Nanny Girty's first house. I was going to be released. They said they were going to drive me back to Wilgespruit but I was afraid that maybe they would shoot me on the way, that maybe they were not really going to let me get home safely. There was a telephone in the next room and I was thinking of calling Wilgespruit and telling them the address where I was so they could start driving out there and then either I could stall so they'd arrive to the house before we'd left, or they'd see us on the way, so that I could not be shot. But I thought it was a risk to try to make that call. the men were all in the other room watching TV. it looked like Jackie Adler's TV room. and they were pretty absorbed in the show and I thought I had a pretty good chance of making the call without any of them noticing, but it was still a risk. I was weighing that risk against the risk of going in the car with them and maybe getting shot. I decided it was safer to go in the car with them. First, I asked one of the men very seriously whether they planned on killing me or whether they really planned on letting me go, and he said they really were going to let me go, they were not going to kill me, etc. The boss of the man who kidnapped me was eating at a restaurant in Chesnut Hill. He was eating clams. He was several floors up, near a window. The other man, at the house, told me that this man was inviting me to dinner, taking me out for dinner before they take me back home. I wanted to go because I thought he'd buy me a very nice, expensive dinner, but there was not time, so I could not go; I was going to eat something at the house instead. I was specifically aware of the fact that they had not beaten or raped me. So on the one hand, I thought that they were good. But on the other hand, they had kidnapped me and made me be afraid for my life, and this was bad. I could not remember the phone number for Wilgespruit. I also wanted to call my mother. She would have been in the car that was coming to meet me e. g. if I had called Wilgespruit and they had driven out to meet me. There were woods nearby, like the ones where in real life I was raped.\n",

      "I went into a hotel room. A sign said something like, The United Nations Community Association is so important that if you live here we will pay all your expenses for a trip to Atlanta if you live in this apartment. It was four apartments in a square, each one an equal piece of the square. There was a door to each apartment from each other apartment and the phone system allowed you to be in touch with each of the four people. The four rooms seemed very well. balanced and integrated, perfect, even and whole. Some information told me that it was solar. heated. The lights seemed bright enough. I was a student and thought for a moment about how I would study if the lights went out, but I decided that if that occurred, I would just go to a friend's house. I was at Adriaan's house looking around and I sawsome nice odds and ends. Like I saw a metal star that I put against my wrist to see how it would look as a bracelet. I decided that Adriaan had some redeeming qualities after all and that I'd like to learn something from him. I decided I'd like to learn the basics of tool. making from him. He said there were four basic types of tools. He mentioned two or three weak types of tool but I wanted to learn the real thing and all four. Adriaan wanted me to learn how to fly. He urged me to take flying lessons. I was afraid to. I told him I was afraid to fly. He urged me. He wanted to arrange a trip that me, him and one other man would take by flying in a private plane, but to do the trip it was necessary that I learn to fly. Finally I decided I would learn to fly. I called up the flight instructor. He was a man who had written several books and I had seen several of his books spread out in a fan. like shape in a low shelf in a book. store the previous day. I think he was also the man behind the United Nations Community Association thing. His secretary answered and said he was not in. I asked if he was going to the class tonight and she said yes. She seemed reluctant to give me the information. I asked if he was leaving from the place and she said yes, so I said, then I can take a ride with him because I have to be in that place and then I'm going directly to the class too. And I can get a ride home with my friend. The secretary said that he'd hurt his leg and was very sick and she did not know if he'd want anyone driving with him because he'd be in too much pain. I said that was exactly why he should not drive alone and if it was an automatic, I could even drive for him. The secretary seemed to agree. I was on trial for murder and the judge was a blonde woman. She was sitting very high up on a judge's seat. For some reason although I was innocent and had a lot of support in the courtroom, she hated me very very strongly. Her uncontrolled hate was very obvious and noticeable to the other people in the courtroom. I kept wondering why she was against me when I had not done anything and why she had such strong feelings against me when she did not even know me. The only conclusion I could reach was that I reminded her of someone that she'd hated as a child and so she was taking it out on me without realizing it. She was sure I was guilty and proceeded with the trial in each instance as if I were already guilty. She did not take my honest statements seriously, like she was mocking me. Everyone in the courtroom seemed to realize that she was being unfair. She looked just like Charlene Afromow. Somehow I was set free and I was going to a skating rink and on my way in I passed Charlene on her way out. I did not know how she would react to me but she asked, are you Susan? it seemed she was not sure about recognizing me. She said it with stiffness and defensiveness, as if she was trying to preserve her pride. Yes, I answered. Then she said something else, something like indicating that she knew I was innocent and she had been unfair, but it was only a three or four word sentence. She was quite stiff and would not just let go and be open and sincere but she really had made an effort and gone way beyond herself to even speak with me and say what she said. I accepted what she said and she walked on her way and I walked on into the rink. Some of the people who'd been at court on my side, witnesses were also in the rink sitting in the benches on the side and they felt good about what had just happened. And that I was free.\n",

      "I went back to Wilgespruit. Mbombo was sleeping. I think in a crib. I woke him up by stroking around his eyes. After a few moments' hesitation, he recognized me and said, Look who's here! Dale was on the couch and had come home late. He did not recognize me. People tried to remind him of who I was but he did not know me. Then later on he recognized me and he told me he knew who I was now, from hearing my voice. He recognized my voice. I saw Tam and he gave me a warm hug. I did not want to leave Wilgespruit. Wanting to travel to other places but wanting to always be able to return to Wilgespruit.\n",

      "2. I was with Robyn Curhan. We were on our way back from somewhere. We went down Nardell Rd. we were in a rickshaw. The rickshaw was very flamboyant. there was some big part of it sticking out to the side. This the rickshaw and this piece of it attracted a lot of attention. It was florally decorated. We decided to go around the block. When we passed Lisa Baumberg's house, I saw that some of the family members were outside on the lawn on chaises. I think it was Jenny and Bob or Arnold and Peggy. Then Lisa came out. Peggy and Lisa and I think also Jennifer encouraged me to come inside and take a tour of the house. I knew that Robyn had to get home, but I said yes to the tour. I said to Robyn within earshot of Lisa. This family has been a very important part of my life. I knew that when I said this, Lisa understood that it referred primarily to the role that both her parents' deaths have played in my life. We started the tour. Where Jenny's old room and Lisa's subsequent room is located in real life, there was a larger room, with 2 or 3 sets of bunkbeds. Gloria was living there. She had been living as a boarder in Lisa's house. I could tell that this had been problematic because of Gloria's personality. to show that I understood, I said something to Lisa to the effect of, She is self. centered, and listed two other of her qualities I cannot remember them now. Lisa agreed and said something to the effect of that it had been practically impossible to live with her. Next we came to a room that was either Lisa's old room, the former guest room subsequently it became Jenny and Laura's room or a combination of the two. I think it was primarily the latter. At this point, Robyn was getting restless because it was late. it was after 200 and she was supposed to be home at 200. She lived in Heidi Nottonson's house. At first I wanted to suggest to her that she just go on her own to Heidi's house, because I wanted to finish the tour, and I wanted the chance to stay at Lisa's longer, but I knew that I was actually supposed to bring her home, not to let her go by herself. I looked at my watch. At this point in real life there was a loud noise and I woke up.\n",

      "2. I was shopping for dresses, with a group from CGE Center for Global Education. One woman in the group asked me if I would accompany her to Nova Scotia. I was considering it but I did not like her that much. I had bracelets of many different types and colors, on each wrist. People were admiring the bracelets. I sat down with the director of the tour. I was explaining to her that I am reluctant to feel indeciph. myself and ask any questions I want because I do not want the others to think I'm an agent. I told her that I've felt very self. conscious in the group. She said, very kindly and honestly, that she had thought I had already gotten over those feelings. I told her no, I still felt that way.\n",

      "1. I am someplace where they give AIDS tests. The scene is the hospital, the hospital area where I took Ken in real life, the waiting area. I have a test and they stamp a mark on my hand. I look at the mark and am sure that it means that I am okay. Then someone suggests that maybe some of the marks mean that one does have AIDS. I look more closely at the mark on my hand. it says AIDS and has flames to each side that look like wings. it is brownish and the wings on fire look like angel's wings. I start to get scared. I ask one of the nurses about it and she looks at it and somehow communicates to me that this means that I have AIDS. I tell her it's impossible and ask her to make the test again. She does it again and confirms that I have AIDS. I think about how much this will hurt my mother. I think about whether or not to tell my mother. The nurse tells me that there is a Jewish girl in Thailand who just died last night in the hospital there, of AIDS. her name does not sound Jewish. and somehow I have the clear impression that she is a whore. I ask if she died there without ever having told her parents at home that she had AIDS, and the nurse said that yes, she did not want to tell her mother because of how it would hurt her andor because she was afraid andor ashamed. I ask the nurse if there are Jews in Thailand because I am surprised by this and she says that yes, there are. I feel sorry for the girl in the Thailand hospital who died alone. I can visualize the girl alone in the hospital and I feel compassion for her. I think that she must have been very brave and very strong not to have needed her mother at a time like that. I have slept with Tzviki the night before, and he is around in the place where I have made the AIDS test. Near Tzvickie there are some other Israelis also. I speak to the nurse in Hebrew, saying something like, be careful not to show him I have AIDS, because I just slept with him last night and he will be alarmed. just as I finish saying this I suddenly remember that it is he who understands Hebrew and the doctornurse who does not understand Hebrew. I feel panicky because I think that Tzvicky must have understood what I just said. But then I realize that he was not really listening closely and he had not been paying attention and therefore did not catch what I had said. At first I feel guilty and assume that I must have given him the AIDS. Then I remember that I have not slept with anyone else in 60 days 2 months, I explain this to the nurse. She writes down something, like a diagram which shows that I must have gotten the AIDS in the last 60 days. it's something like that 60 days is the time period that it will show up on the test and just 60 days beforeearlier I had an AIDS test which had been negative, which means that it had to be in the last 60 days. Then I slowly realize that this means that I must have gotten the AIDS from Tzviki, not given it to Tzviky. but even though factually and objectively this seems to be true, I cannot really believe it. mostly because I feel that I am the bad one and he is the good one, that I am the woman and he is the man, and also that I am promiscuous whereas he probably has not slept with many women. I think about whether to call my mother and realize that this is not something I can tell my mother over the phone. it will hurt her too much. She is in the bedroom on Nardell Rd. , with Martin, only the bedroom is much bigger. I can really feel how much this is going to hurt her and this really hurts me. I think of calling Uncle Buzzy or Aunt Cynthia instead. The phones where I think of phoning Uncle Buzz or Aunt Cynthia are at the Bradford Hotel. I decide it is probably a good idea to call Aunt Cynthia in Florida to ask for advice. It's possible that by the telephones, I also feel a strong connection to Mark, and I think about the fact how that in the end, no matter what, your strongest ties are to your family, as mine are to Mark and my mother. I am in a chapel; it is big. The rabbi is there, they are saying all kinds of prayers. It is very big and there are lots of people there. I go away from the main service and crawl under a table; there is a prayerbook there. I open the prayerbook and try to really pray, from my heart. My prayer stands in contrast to the noises that are going on around me. I am sitting on the floor, or kneeling or crouching on the floor, under a wooden table in the churchtemple, I am kneeling like on one knee, and I am uttering my own prayer, it is different from the prayers of all the others. As I say it, I am dovening. A small portion of the prayer is the Reader's Kaddish but most of the prayer is my own. I am in a temple, could be Beth Avodah or Mishkan Tefila. I expect to see Lisa Baumberg there or Jennifer. I am in touch with the fact that before I die, I have to somehow make my peace with that family, especially with Lisa. I think about whether I should write her another letter or whether I should see her and try to talk with her directly. I am not sure which is better but I know that I have to straighten things out with her before it's too late. I think she is in the lobby of the temple and so I do but I'm blank. The scene in Beth Avodah's lobby. I think Jennifer is around there, but a young Jennifer. maybe 2 or 3 years old. she looks like a doll I used to have, which had blonde hair. I suspect that if Jennifer is around then probably Lisa is also around to take care of her at such a young age so I look for Lisa. The feeling for Lisa Baumberg and the need to straighten things out with her is very very strong. It is like a certainty, a knowledge, that I cannot die until I have done that. My mother is going to play tennis with Martin. The tennis courts are enclosed behind large very tall solid walls. It looks like nobody can go in there. This was the time that I'd planned to tell her about the AIDS, but she is busy, she is going to play tennis. So I realize that I will have to tell her some other time. This is at an apartment building, like the one in Watertown where Nanny used to live. Tennis court scene. looks like our apartment in Florida Lakeworth. The tennis courts are to my left. They are enclosed. very high walls, solid walls. you cannot get in or penetrate. The nurse does not really empathize with me or care. She is just doing her job. the testing is taking place in something like an auditorium. I ask the nurse in a very clear, adult tone, what are the odds that a person with Human Immunodeficiency Virus will actually come down with AIDS. She says I think the chances are 30. I calculate and realize that this means I have a 2 out of 3 chance not to get AIDS, but in some way I at first for a moment I calculate it as a 2 out of 3 chance to get AIDS, until I realize that I miscalculated; but despite this statistic, somehow I can feel that I am one of the people who will die. Heidi Farrish is around. Heidi Farrish. is around. she is sorry that I have AIDS. she tells me that she is sorry that I have AIDS. I can feel that she really means it. I am going away somewhere. Heidi understands that I have to go away. I think I'm going on a bicycle. I imagine how I will plan a funeral in advance in a way that is empowering for everyone. I decide to write something very moving, something about my attitude towards life and death, then I realize that I can actually make an audiocassette and then I realize that I can actually make a videocassette of this speech. I think that the videocassette will be the best option, because it is the most real, it is like I am really there, but I think about my mother and I remember Benjy's Olifant service and I think about how after I am dead if my mother sees that videocassette at the funeral it will really drive her mad. I think I want to do the videocasette but I am not sure because I do not want to hurt my mother too much. I think about how in my speech I will be very strong and clear and empowering and inspiring; I will emphasize that I had a really full life and I did practically everything that I wanted to do in life. I feel that this will probably help to console my mother. Besides, it is also true. I can visualize the people being in the service after I am gone. I can visualize Aunt Cynthia and I know that she will also be very hurt by my dying but I know that for her it will be easier than for my mother. I think that probably she will actually feel the irony of the fact that she is getting old and still alive while I am young and am dying. I can visualize her face and she looks a little old and kind of worn and like she is keeping a lot inside, behind the screen. I am searching for the Palestinian woman doctor. I somehow senseknow that she is the only one who can help me now. I am in an apartment complex. I am riding up and down the elevator; I am searching for her. I am looking for her name. I cannot find her. There is someone working in the building, a worker. I ask him or her if the Palestinian doctor lives there. I think that the answer is yes. The apartment building where I look for the Palestinian doctor looks like the place I lived in Bangladesh, with Kurshid. it is in Kurshid's apartment complex. I think that probably this explains why I have had a sore throat for a while; although several other of the symptoms I do not have, such as headache. I try to tell myself that maybe since I do not have all of the symptoms, it is not real. I feel very much afraid. Then, a voice tells me, or I tell myself, it's okay, sweetheart, it was a dream. then I sort of realize that this is a dream and I start to wake up. but it is some moments before I really realize that this is a dream and I do not really have AIDS. I am thinking about the chances, the odds of survival, when I wake up.\n",

      "2. I go to my father's grave. No. it was my grandmother's grave. We are near Watertown. Marjie Saltiel is with me, and so is someone else, a third person. We get to the area where the graveyard is, and I decide that I want to see my grandmother's grave and my father's grave. This is the place where my Uncle Charles's grave is. I want to see my grandmother's grave and Uncle Charles's grave. they are both in the same area. Marjie is with me sitting at a table. in a restaurant or coffee shop that was part of the Watertown apartment complex. and she does not want to come with me to the grave. she wants to just stay there at the table comfortable. I am annoyed that she does not want to come with me to the graves. I am annoyed that Marjie did not come with me. I am on a tour in some part of the world near Russia. The tour guide, who is a woman, decides that it is also possible to go across the border into Russia and maybe Poland, to make a tour there. I am on a bus, I think it is a tour bus. I decide that I want to go back to Russia, that I want to try and find the villages where my grandmother ancestors used to live. I decide that I want to try and locatefind the areas where they used to live. I ask the tour guide if we might be going near Kiev, because I know that Slutzk is near Kiev and she says something like yes, of course we'll be going to blank, which is some town near Kiev. The tour operator agrees to take me to Russia. I figure out in my mind that while the tour is doing the tour things, I can go off on my own and explore these places that are important to me. The tour operator is trying to find other people that also want to go on the tour to Russia. I figure out in my mind that I can go to Russia directly from this trip, and then I can go home, and then go to Israel, rather than going directly to Israel, and it would still be okay if I got to Israel a little later. I think that it would be good to research into both sides of my family tree and to try to locate the places from both sides, not just the Redacted. Surname side. This seems possible because we will also pass through somewhere in Poland. I am staying in a condominium type of place, for the wealthy. I think it is our condominium in Florida. A girl comes to the door. She is going door to door. Something about animals. She is selling something, I think she is selling animals or like asking people door to door if they will help her buy animals, and they have to like write down on a indeciph. which animal they will buy her and how much it costs, and how much they'll donate toward it, something like that. My mother is in the house with me. At first, I do not really want to help the girl, but my mother writes down Seal and some expensive price, I think it is 200. I think that this is an awfully expensive donation to make to the girl but my mother does not seem to mind, and I remember that she has plenty of extra money so for her this is no big deal. The girl who comes to the door. I do not really want to help her. but my mother does want to help her, and this surprises me. The girl wants to obtain a seal. There is a store or library in the grave area at the graveyard. I decide to go and look there for something about my father or grandmother. There is a bookshelf. It has books there that I recognize as, or conclude as, belonging to my father. At least one of the books is on aerodynamics. There are like studies that have been published, scientific studies, of which he is the author or which are connected with him in some way. I pick up some of the books and look in the index to see if his name is mentioned there. I am surprised mildly that it is not mentioned in the indexes but I know he has a connection to these books in any case. Somebody, I think it must have been my mother, has like donated the books to this place as a kind of memorium to my father. Like in honor or in memory of my father. So nobody has thrown these books away. they have been kept over the years. In the area where the grave is. I think also my grandmother's grave, although it could be my father's grave. there are like some narrow steps on all four sides, leading up to a plaque or a platform. They are not really steps but layers, levels. In the center is the plaque which is, I guess, the grave. Stairs to the grave. like accordion. or mausoleum. I think Aunty Erma is around.\n",

      "2. I am with a group of Americans at a kibbutz. The Americans are older and they look like people you would see on a tour. They. the Filipino people. have elected a president of the kibbutz. They have elected an American Israeli. I cannot imagine the logic of this, why they the Filipinos would choose an American Israeli to be head of their kibbutz. I think about it and it does not make sense to me. I cannot understand why they would elect an American to be their president. I talk to the person about it who was elected president, but he does not want to hear, he's not interested. Then suddenly I get the idea that maybe they did this indeciph. , that is, maybe they arranged the elections to have the American win specifically so that it would incense the people's nationalism, like as a reaction, pride. I took a walk with the person elected president. he is a large, fat man. and I tell him that maybe the reason he's been elected president is so as to fuel the people's nationalism. Nobody takes this seriously but I am sure that it is the accurate thesis. Walking. me and the fat man are like walking through a path in a natural, wooded type of area. The President does not want to give up the Presidency. He is being stubborn. He is somehow sure that they have elected him because they like him, not for any other, ulterior reason. He does not want to face the truth that maybe they are using him. We are sitting at a table, me, this tour group, and maybe some of the top Filipinos. I voice my objections to the idea of an American Israeli having been elected to be president of the kibbutz, emphasizing the issue of nationalism. One of the people, a woman tour group, gives a short speech saying that none of us really wanted to stay there permanently, or at least, she did not think so, and so it was not fair in a way for all of us to take on the presidency of the kibbutz, because we would be leaving. it was selfish in a way. I agreed with what she was saying, but after she said it, I decide that maybe I want to stay on the kibbutz permanently. of the whole group, maybe I am the one who does want to stay on the kibbutz. But I do not interrupt her. We are seated at a banquet table, like a dining room table. At the banquet, I or someone says something which somehow causes the Filipinios there to feel a surge of nationalism. Then I realize that my thesis was correct. this was all staged and calculated so as to make the people in the kibbutz more nationalistic. The running mate of the man was a Jewish girl from Newton, or maybe she was from Allston. Me and a man from the tour go to the place where the ballots have been counted or the final vote has been taken, it is like a post office type of place; there is a counter there. I look at the sheet of paper and see this person's name as the top vote. getter, i. e. president, and the running mate's name as the second one, along with their religion and what city they are from. That's when I see that the running mate is Jewish, and that makes matters even worse. I try to tell the people that after that, at the dinner banquet, It's ridiculous for you to have a Jewish person and an American as president of your kibbutz! I am implying that they should have a Filipino. But they do not really want to listen.\n",

      "4. I am with Sybille, on some kind of tour, near Boston. We are nearing the end of the tour, the last day or two, and then we'll have to go home, so we are trying to decide what to do with the last day or 2 days. At first I am planning fast and trying to find a way to do everything. all in 2 days; Sybille is interested in a different approach. She wants to spend a lot of time, from 6. 10 that night, at one particular museum, I think it is some type of historical museum. I wonder if it is open at night, and if so plan to also go there. Then somehow I suddenly realize that I'm around Worcester, anyway I'm someplace near Boston, so I do not need to try to see and do everything in one day, I can wait until next time, because it's not far, I can always come back. It is Sybille who came there here and that indeciph. will never come back. I emphasize to Sybille that she ought to see the Aquarium, it is one of the best, most important places to see in the Boston area, she does want to see the Aquarium, but she is not sure that she wants to make the time for it, because that's a major trip. She wants to go there but she does not know if she will have the time. Sybille wants to go there but she does not know if she has the time, because it is as major trip, it will take a long time, and she does not know if she has the time. She thinks of maybe saving the Aquarium for another time because it's not really convenient for her to get there now. I encourage her to go now. I emphasize to her that the Aquarium is the most important thing to see in the Boston area and she should sacrifice everything else in order to see it. I emphasize that no matter what, she ought to go there. She ought to make the effort and deal with making the effort and the inconvenience, etc. Sybille does not really agree. She thinks that maybe it's better to wait, to see if indeciph. all right, to wait until I'm all right, and to spend time at the museum for now and take it easy for now. When I realize that I am near Boston anyway, and can work this out any time in the future, it does not necessarily have to be now, it's like a shock for me, a surprise, a sudden revelation.\n",

      "I am in a jungle area. it looks like the African bush. I am with a group of people. There is an animal. maybe a lion or tiger or bear. It corners me and bites me on the foot, like on the front part of my foot. I do not know what to do, how to behave. no one told me about what to do in a situation like this. The tour leader says to act submissive but I also have an instinct to run and also I am tempted to fight, to wrestle with him. maybe he is a mountain gorilla? I am torn between conflicting impulses run. wrestle. act submissive and do not know what to do. Somehow, he is gone. There is a wound on my foot. it is a pretty bad wound, but not dangerously bad. It hurts, but I can see that it will heal. I can see that it will be quite some time before it heals properly. I think maybe this is a concentration camp. Somehow, I get permission to go back to the main area. It looks like the ski area in the Hermon. There, I have the opportunity to take the GREs again, which I am thinking of doing in order to improve my Math score, but if I take them again I could also do worse, and you do not get to choose which score to accept and which to reject. if you take them again you have to be willing to take all of them. I am not sure what to do. whether to take the risk of doing better or worse or stay safe with what I already have. I am really not sure what to do. Because of the foot wound, and I have been sent back to this main area, I decide to take the test again. I take it again. I am tempted slightly to cheat, because I know I could probably get away with it, or rather, the thought crosses my mind that maybe they will think I have cheated, since no one is supervising me, but I do not cheat. It turns out that I have done very well on the test. better than before. The guy at the front desk tells me this. I feel relieved. Most vivid scene on the ground, cowering, from the animal lion?. I do not know whether to rebel or to submit.\n",

      "1. There is a guy from South Africa, from the security police. I am going to teach a class, I think it's on film; or weaving. On a particular type of film. At the beginning of the class I give an introductory lecture, and no one wants to hear. No, wait. there is one woman who does not want to hear. I send her out of the room. I tell the others that I refer to that one as a girl, not as a woman, because she is childish. I rubscratch the back of some of the students in the class they are all women. As the teacher, I care about them and feel protective toward them. I have to get somewhere else. Denise is supposed to come and see me. I am going to meet Steve Lepore. Somewhere a long drive away. Alan Levine. From the class, I take a film with me, an animated film. What I am going to do now, at night, there is something illicit about it. like to do with drugs or something. It is getting late and I realize that DeniseTrish is not coming. Jeffrey Redacted Surname. maybe that's who I am going to meet. On the way, a South African police man detains me. me, and a man. I think the man is a Palestinian activist. Each of us are put in hermetically sealed rooms with small windows that have glass over them. At first I did not realize they had glass over them, I thought it was open air and that the guy in the next room would hear me if I talked, but then the interrogator tells me that it's sealed. I saw that the interrogator, when interrogating the man, the activist, hit him on the head and was cruel to him. I am afraid; I do not want to be hit. I play the part of the supplicant. the fact that I am Mark's little sister helps me because this is Alan Levine's older brother. Also, I had a film with me, and so he plays the film, and when he sees that it's just animated characters, it makes me look like an innocent little girl. When we first got to the compound. I overheard a man talking, saying something like that what he the interrogator especially hates are T. shirts implying political T. shirts, and I feel worried because in my bag I have a liberation T. shirt. In the interrogation room, I am afraid what the man the activist in the next room will think of me if somehow he hears or finds out that I am groveling. The man in the interrogation room is mean. But he lets me go. I go, and as I am leaving, I think about the man who is still locked in there, and I think about whether somehow I could help him, pass a note to someone about it, or whatever, and I decide that I am too scared. that I do not want to take the chance of going back there, that it's too risky. I have been let go but if I show myself to be an activist. I will not be let off again so easily. I realize that life is much more complicated than I had thought. I feel sad about how Dale and Tish would thinkfeel about this my behavior now. giving up, no longer wanting to participate or help but I do not really see the alternative. But I have not forgotten him. I am still thinking about him. I am just not sure how I can help him. I am walking back to my house in Wayland. Alan Levine lives next door or nearby, a few doors down. I have a sexual affair with the interrogator, after my release. Although I do not like him as a person, I am sexually turned on by his power and stature. And also I want to use him to try and get on his good side, so I can help my friend. At one point, me and the interrogator rape the interrogator's wife, that is, we have sex on top of her, she is underneath us, getting crushed. At an earlier point, she the wife found out that we'd been sleeping together. After I am released, I cannot talk to anybody about what happened. Denise, Mark, etc. because I know that I am being followed everywhere, watched, tape recorded, surveiled, etc. , because I know how the South African police are, how thorough they are, so I feel trapped because I cannot talk with anyone about what happened. it is too risky. And my house is bugged.\n",

      "There is a baby in a crib; she is 2 weeks old. She is waiting to be adopted. Her mother has abandoned her, without giving her milk. She is Korean. She is in the Ulpan Akiva; Hassan is a teacher there. I have come to see Hassan; by mikreh, I see the baby; looks like the Philippines baby abandoned by her father. There is a woman there, who is in charge of the babies in the orphanage; I am indignant that this baby's mother left her just 2 weeks after her birth. I give her milk from a bottle with a very small nipple; she sucks it and it is clear that she really needed the milk, she really wanted it. The woman in charge gives me a bigger nipple, more like a passifier, and this one is better for the baby to suck. I think about whether to adopt her. When kissed, the baby smiles and even laughs. she is happy. The baby says a sentence about Etti; the woman in charge, and myself, are surprised that she can speak a real sentence when she is only 2 weeks old. The woman in charge mentions that till now, she had not even spoken a word; I feel that it is my presence that has brought her alive, allowed her to speak. The woman in charge says something about the verbal side of her brain being highly developed, but that other parts of her brain may be damaged by the lack of mothering. I am certain that because of having been abandoned by her mother, she will have some brain damage later in life, damage to other parts of her brain. Later, when Etti is visiting her, someone says something about the verbal half of her brain being pumped up with thiazine, and that is why she is able to speak so well. I feel ambivalent, torn. feel that I want to adopt her but it just is not time yet for me to have a baby, that I am not yet ready to take care of someone else, that I still want to travel and have fun, etc. But on the other hand I want to take care of her and I know this is a perfect chance to make a difference in someone's life. Later I find out she is from Korea. I bring Etti and Kathi Hasegawa to see her; I hope that one of them will adopt her instead of me. Etti wants to adopt her. There is a girl with blonde hair. the daughter of Etti, and we see that the little girl in the orphanage. she has now grown to look like Naomi. has exactly the same hair color, and also has blue eyes, so I suggest that if she adopts her, they will really look like sisters. I have come to see Hassan in the Ulpan; I take my shirt off and am wearing my bra. I am not sure whether he wants to see me or not. He himself seems ambivalent. A woman from the Ulpan is around. I come to see him but in the end I see the baby. I am torn about whether or not to adopt her, I know that it would not really be a responsible thing to do at this point in my life.\n",

      "I have left my baby in the room, the hotel room. Suddenly I realize that I have not fednursed her at all since she's been born a few days earlier. 2 days earlier. In terror, I run back to the room, I fling the door open, she is in the crib, and she looks very sick, very bad, but she is not yet dead. There is still a chance that she will live. I look over on the floor, there is a couple man and woman there, naked, with the same illnessproblem as the baby. that is, grossly deformed skin. I am relieved that the baby is not dead, but scared that it's too late, that the damage has been done and she will not recover. Earlier, I had been with Tom Couhig. And Tom's wife. I was still attracted to Tom. I introduced him, This is my daughter, and he was surprised that I have a daughter, that, apparently, I am a single parent. He has a daughter too. His wife is a little jealous of me, she can sense that I am still attracted to him, that we are still attracted to each other. Tom and his wife are going out to eat, to a restaurant that I recommended to them. Nanny and Zady. I am in New Haven, Connecticut, Lee is around. It is nighttime, and I am afraid of being raped, I start to scream and cry and freak out, Lee hears but he does not understand that it's connected to the rape, he just thinks that it's weirdbizarre that I'm screaming. I want to tell him it is PTSD, because I'm in a situation that reminds me of the night I was raped, but somehow I cannot tell him. Last scene very vivid. the baby, looking all swollen and grotesque. dark. earlier she was blonde. When I introduced her to Tom, she was blonde, about aged 3 When I am screaming in pain about the rape, the PTSD, Zady calls me, and his voice is very caring, gentle, and concerned. He wants to come and get me. He wants me to come and sleep at his house. At first I try to hem and haw a minute but then I realize that I really would like to sleep there, that Hartford is not far from New Haven and it makes sense. We leave it that either he will come and pick me up where I am, or I will drive the 2 and a half hours to reach him. I forget which. Earlier. a woman authority figure, like a program director at school or something, is telling me that when I was at the Committee on Homelessness, someone complained about my performance, something like I did not put a phone into one of the childcare centers at the shelters I set up. And that my clinicaltherapeutic skills would have to be worked on by my being in therapy myself. Tom Couhig. very vivid. In one scene I go to his house. There is the sense that we will meet again, that there is still something between us. The baby. looks grossly deformed, swollen, black dark like razor stubble No one knows for sure if she will survive or die. Just as I reach her, and see how badly she needs to be fed, I am simultaneously aware that my breasts are flat and not milk. filled. there is no milk in them. But I know that she was just born 2 days ago and so, anatomically, my breasts must be producing milk. I conclude that when I start to nurse her, when she starts to pull at my breast with her mouthteeth, the milk will start to flow. like priming a pump earlier scene Zady is going to pick me up and everything is going to be all right. Only I forgot to get the address. He's coming to pick me up once I get to the general vicinity, because I do not know where his new house is. But I have to get there part way on my own. Last scene the main thing is the baby's head. it is grotesquely large. I do not remember the body much. baby's head large, and dark. razor stubble? Tom and his wife are eating at the restaurant which I recommended.\n",

She asks me Have you ever been raped? I say Yes, and briefly tell her the story. She asks something about what did the police do, what happened in the end. At first I said, Nothing. Then I mentioned that they found the guy and arrested him. Then suddenly, as we are talking with what seems to be a mutual understanding, a guy forces the door open and gets in, she's in on this too. they were working in collaboration. it was a trick. the guy says drive. The guy. seems young, kind of chubbyplump, also has dark hair, looks a little like Faris, kind of young, maybe in his teens ?. I feel betrayed, stunned. Next scene.

One heart. to the side, not frontways maybe It's a lovely ring. Other people are leaving. by plane or by boat. I'm afraid to take the boat. I'm afraid of the waves, the seasickness, and the possibility of capsizing. Besides, it is a very long trip by boat. And I do not have the money to fly. Looks like I might have to drive. That's the longest, most difficult way. But I have packed and I'm not really sure I cannot catch the plane with them. I try the silver ring, her ring, on my finger.

I contact a travel agent and it turns out it is going to cost like 1800 or something, a lot of money. So I am not sure I can or will go. But somehow I am in the Arctic and there are beautiful views.

I realize that I need to take the subway. it will be quicker and there is still a chance that I might not miss the entire appointment and maybe I could see her for a little while. I am asking the driver about what to do since I am not familiar with the Brooklyn subway system. . Earlier. Alisa and I ended up in Connecticut. at my relatives' house. my mother is there. everyone is going to be going to some kind of functionparty in honor of my grandparents. I am still planning to go to that too after my appointment with Lila.

Is the subway dangerous? I ask Alisa, but she is on the phone with her father and can only be interrupted for a minute. . We are driving by over the subway. me and the NY people. we pass by a frozen lake where it seems there are two dead bodies. also a beggar on the subway who talks about the poor work situation and not earning enough to live. everybody mocks him he looks like the guy from Health Care for the Homeless. . I am so afraid of missing the whole appointment. even if I can only be there for a little while it's better than missing the whole thing. Oh, first there was a taxi driver, a man who kisses another man indeciph. , they both were drunk, who drives me to the wrong place, far from Lila's office.\n",

Wait. earlier I start talking about Wilgespruit. my mother asks me something about why certain things were written on papers there that I'd sent home and indeciph. I explained something about Wilgespruit, my mother disagreed and said it's not like that, it's like that. I realized what she was doing and could see Alisa nodding her head in agreement with me I am in the back seat, Alisa is driving the car and I kind of shout at my mother This is demeaning! I was there for 6 months, I worked there, and I've visited three times since then, and I did research there, and you're trying to say that you know more than me about Wilgespruit? That's insulting to me and I will not put up with it! Alisa is nodding. I do not know how my mother reacts. . later . I am at Wilgespruit; I want to make a going. away party. There is like a conference center part, where one can rent a room that's bigger than just my own room, almost like a bat. mitzva type dance hall. But instead of being owned by Wilgespruit, this time it's owned by a very greedy man. My mother is wearing diamond earrings and a Pierre. Cardan pocketbook, but something has happened and she does not have much cash at all, hardly any cash, maybe even none. And we are trying to convince the room. rental guy to let us rent the room in any case because she has resources and assets in the United States. But the guy does not believe me. he thinks we are trying to con him. He does not believe that my mother is a rich woman. I try to tell him, She has a 50. foot yacht, etc. etc. but he thinks this is all made. up stories, he does not believe there is any truth to it and I cannot prove it because we do not have cash. I tell the guy, You can phone this and that number in the United States, here, let me get you the number, go ahead and phone, you can check, you can verify, but the man does not want to, he thinks this is all a ploy, because he cannot understand how we could really be rich and have resources and assets if we do not have any cash with us, he is thinking that a rich person would not travel without cash. I am becoming more and more anxious and it starts to seem that this guy really does not believe us and there is no way we can prove to him that we are rich, no matter what we say or do, without any cash to show him. I wake up from the anxiety. of trying to convince him that my mother has money and not being believed, of being stranded in a foreign country without any cash.\n",

      "I am in Georgetown, looking around frantically Efraim's books, Bridge St. books, etc. for the book by Adrienne Rich, either In Search of a Common Language or The Fact of a Doorframe, so I can find that poem and copy it before my session with Lila, since I forgot to bring the book with me from home my session is on Connecticut Avenue, towards Maryland, further away from Georgetown. I am looking for the book but no one seems to find it and meanwhile the clock is ticking and I am going to be late. I decide I'd better take a taxi instead of the subway since it is already 230 This is a Thursday, the session starts at 230, but when I try to find a taxi they are all being driven by Orthodox Jews who say it will be dark soon and they do not want to drive on Shabbat. It's as if either this is a Friday, not Thursday, or as if Shabbat is on Thursday here. I try to assure them that I'll be at Connecticut Avenue before it's too late but they do not seem convinced. . Then it turns out that at least one of them only wants more money, he wanted me to offer more money. I only have about 30  cash on me, like a 20  bill and a 10  bill, loose in my open pocketbook, I do not have it in a wallet or anything it's that bag I used to have that does not close. We are arguing and bargaining about the price but I am trying to emphasize that I need to go now or I will miss the session. . Before that, I was facilitating a poetry therapy session at NAPT National Association of Poetry Therapy, there was a very big turnout because people heard about last year's workshop, and Martha starts with a kind of brief introduction, and then I start, I am going to start with 1 particular poem but I am in a hurry because I need to get to the session with Lila, I'm not willing to miss the session with Lila in order to be at NAPT so I decide to just read 1 poem and run out, let Martha help run the workshop and let the people there manage by themselves, even though they will be disappointed. But when I am about to read this 1 poem, I see that people are not really paying attention to me, they are kind of talking and doing other things, distracted, and I am about to read anyway and then I say No. I am not going to read. Most of you who know me know that I read with passion, and I am vulnerable when I read, and I am not willing to do it in this room, while people are not paying attention. Those who know me understand. . I get up and leave. There is a sense that I have done the right thing, I feel that this is a time when I have done the right thing. Even though earlier, when I said I was not willing to miss my therapy session, some people were kind of irritated that I would choose to go to my own therapy session instead of leading the workshop I am supposed to lead. . As soon as I get outside I am looking for the taxi. Some of the taxis are normal like NY taxis and a few are like those horse  buggies. When the Jewish man tells me he cannot take me because it's Shabbat I start to get in another cab, that is being driven by a black woman. I am about to get into her cab when the Jewish man comes to me and says something like in Hebrew Do not go with her, she's black and I answer him in Hebrew, indignant, something like And people used to say the same thing about our people! i. e. implying that he ought to be ashamed of himself. . Earlier, when I was looking for the bookstores, in one place up in an attic. type area there are some men, I think they are Israeli men, who are rude to me  make kind of threatening sexist remarks, I shout back at them and leave. I am choosing not to suffer uselessly? .\n",

      "3. I am trying to hail a rickshaw to get to Lila, it is just 2 minutes' toll and I am on a cobblestone street not far from her office even though this is in a different country,  I am fervently hoping against hope that if I get a rickshaw now I still might make it to the appointment on time. But the rickshaws are all just passing me by, none of them are wanting to stop for me it seems. At one point a few start to congregate as if they are about to stop, then they start looking nervous  it turns out the police is coming, the police will arrest the rickshaw drivers for one reason or another, I am pretty sure I will not be arrested since I am a foreigner This is in Bangladesh, Dhaka. These are automated rickshaws, you know, motor rickshaws I am jumping up and down, waving my arms, frantically trying to get the taxi, but none are stopping, one looks like he might stop for me but just at the same time 1 or 2 Bangladeshi women also want to get in, I shout Bideshi! Bideshi! the Bangladeshi word for foreigner as if he will understand that this means he is likely to get more money from me than from the Bengali women, but this seems to only make it worse, as he takes them and not me. What happened earlier is this I was riding on my bicycle to get to my session with Lila, it seemed I would have ample time but then I noticed that the wheel was wobbly and more importantly, the steering wheel of the bicycle. what is that called. handle bars. is like wobbling from side to side, it is not working properly. I am tempted to just keep going since I am close to where Lila is but I realize it could be dangerous. I am torn between wanting to continue and wanting to stop. Finally I decide that I had better pull over and take care of this situation, because it could be unsafe to continue on the path, so I pull over  am going to look for a place to stay. So it seems I must have been riding there the day before the session rather than the day of the session. As soon as I pull over almost right at my feet there is a guest house, it looks welcoming and safe somehow, a safe space in which to be for a while, I step inside  I can see right away that it is a feminist guesthouse, there is a feminist atmosphere here and I feel right at home. It is almost like the atmosphere in one of those group homes I used to like, a feeling of community. And cool women, really cool women, the kind that are like Mariana. But these women are older than me and it seems they are more mature and more authentic in their convictions and commitments than I have been. Anyway, they tell me, take so  so's room, implying that it is not just an ordinary guestroom like the others but the room of one of the women who lives in the house, like who runs the guesthouse. apparently it is being run by a feminist cooperative, a women's coop. I go up some stairs to the room and it looks like a nice room in which to spend an evening, very spacious. There is some jewelry loose on the dresser, I think. some earrings. Then I look out the window  I notice there is a fire escape and that we are only on the 2nd floor, a short way off the ground, and that makes the whole thing look different, and not only that, but at this very moment a man is climbing up the fire escape in the next apartment. I go to tell the owners but I do not remember what their reaction is. I think I might be naked too, but I do not remember. Anyway. when it is time to leave I must leave in a big hurry because I am running late. So I am trying to get out of there quickly and in my haste I am throwing twenty dollar bills at the woman who runs the guest house, the woman with whom I'd previously gotten along so well, the other night, when things were more superficial, but now that push comes to shove she can see how I really am, how out of control, self. centered, self. absorbed and immature I am and what a long way I have to go before I can be like her and the other women who run this guest house. she is kind of taking her time even though she knows I am in a big hurry. because she heard me tell a man near her that I have a very important doctor's appointment at 11. it is now about 5. 10 minutes till 11. and I even say something like that if I do not get to the appointment on time today then I will have to wait a month for another appointment. but she still does not seem to be hurrying. she is taking her time. what is it. painstaking. trying to work out the question about how much money I owe, how many nights did I stay at the guest house, what amenities did I use, etc. a silver earring was on the dresser in the room that I stayed in Meanwhile the clock is ticking and I realize that if I continue having this discussion I am going to run out of time  miss my session. oh, I remember what happened now. it was a Tuesday when I started out on my bicycle,  I missed my Tuesday session because I totally forgot about it when I came into the guest house  fell asleep here. now it is Wednesday  I realize that if I do not leave soon I am going to miss the Wednesday session as well. The man next to the woman had sold me some whiskey earlier, a bottle of Southern Comfort, and now he wants his money and we are arguing about the price. he wants more money than I think he should have. so we are standing here arguing about the price. no, I remember. what happened is this I gave him a 20. 00 dollar bill, he then revealed that 20 was a lot for 1 or 2 bottles of Southern Comfort, so then I am confused because I do not know how much it is supposed to be, so I want him to tell me, but he will not tell me directly, apparently because he's not supposed to accept money, these things are supposed to appear as gifts, so he's not really allowed to say the price explicitly, but meanwhile I am frustrated because I want to know and I am in a hurry. But he will not say. So I throw a ten at him,  I wonder if this is enough, if this is the right amount, and somehow the woman reveals to me that the price for the Southern Comfort was about 9. 40 or 9. 60 so I realize that this way he has only a 40c tip or a 60c tip which I know is not a very big tip but I decide to just let it be since I need to go and because it's not my fault that he would not tell me the correct price. That's when the woman starts now discussing with me about her price, and at first I am just going along with this as if I have no choice but then there is this moment when I realize that I really do have a choice, that I can just walk out and rush to my appointment  deal with all this other stuff later, that it does not matter what she or this man will think of me, what happens with my bicycle which is still here, or with a few things that I think I might have left in the room I stayed in, that the most important thing is getting to my session with Lila now and I decide to go now no matter what the cost. so I shove 3 20s 60  at the woman. this is more than enough since I only stayed there 1 night  it's about 20  a night.  I say I'll be back later  we'll work out the details later, I need to go now,  I leave. I feel kind of liberated  surprised to realize that I actually could have left all along but I did not see it, to see that I am free to choose what I do and what I do not do, to see that all it takes is a word from me and no one can stop me if I really make the decision. All it takes is a word from me but I just did not see it, like Dorothy  the ruby slippers. Then I run outside. it is a little like Cinderella rushing out of the ball. and that's when I find myself on the street trying to wave down a taxi. I try  try with taxis  none of them are stopping, they just pass me by, so that's when I finally decide to try with baby taxis, even though there are fewer of them and they take much longer because they cannot go as fast. It's just down the hill, I tell the drivers, the Upper West Side, corner of 82nd  Riverside drive, it's not far, etc. etc. , like I am trying to convince them but for some reason they will not stop. oh I see, it looks like all of them are already full, they all already have at least 1 other passenger, so the available light is not on, the occupied light is on, I just cannot find one that is empty or free. I wake up anxious because of not being able to get any taxis, not even the baby taxis, to stop or to listen to me.\n",

      "I am with my mother, on a journey, near a big mountain. It is on Monday, and my appointment with Lila is for Tuesday morning, but there is a chance that if I leave her a phone message by Monday afternoon perhaps, she could see me on Monday, because I really want to see her. We left it like that, that I could call to schedule an appointment, but so far I did not call. Anyway, I think this is somewhere in California. Like, near where Renni might be. Maybe Southern California. Like near a university, I think. And something happens, and my mother tells me that my father never really committed suicide. That whole story was just a big mistake. She tells me, they never really did find him on the floor of the garage, no, the story did not go like that at all. Instead, the story went like this he was in the house, and he had to go out for some reason, and he just got into the car, it was my mother's car, and she drove a standard or some other kind of unusual car, a car that he did not know how to drive, and so he could not get the car to go, but he was in the garage, so he went back inside and somewhere inside the house he fell asleep from the smoke. So, he did not really kill himself. He was not trying to die, he died while he was trying to live; it was not a suicide at all. It all depends on the story you tell. Lila, Lila, I need Lila. I need Lila. I need Lila. Anyway, I am thinking, oh, wow, all these years have gone by, and my whole life I've been telling myself the wrong story. Wow. And I did not even know it. How could it be? And now I have to go back and correct everything, and tell Lila the truth, about how the first story I told her was not the real story, and how my father did not want to die at all, he wanted to live, and he wanted me to live, and he loved me, but it's so confusing because it is different from the story that I know. And you are not supposed to suddenly change the story after you have been telling it for years and years. I do not know what to make of this new information that my mother has just discovered, which I never had access to before. It is perplexing. I am thinking, wow, perhaps I never really knew him at all. Perhaps I really had no idea what was going on for him on the day that he died, here I've been thinking he wanted so much to die when perhaps what the real story is is that he wanted so much to live. To live, live, live, live, live. But who can really know? It's so strange, so strange how you can never really know the truth about anything or anyone, all you can do is try to tell the best story, i. e. the one that makes your life the fullest, otherwise what is the point of telling a story at all, if not to make a life more interesting? Anyway, I really want to call Lila to make an appointment with her for this afternoon Monday, but it's now sometime around 3 or 4 o'clock, and I doubt that she will be able to see me today, but perhaps if she is checking her machine every hour or so and she says Yes, come in today, I could still come in today, before she is finished working for the day. I am trying to call her, to leave her a message. Earlier, there was another part, when I am in the car with my mother, someone else is driving the car, and my mother tells me something about my father having had grandiose delusions. And I think, Oh, she probably means like Jeffrey, like the kind of stuff Jeffrey used to talk about. And I am sure that my father never had psychiatrically grandiose delusions, like real psychiatric grandiosity, so I ask my mother, and my mother says, Oh yes, yes, he had grandiose delusions, but when I probe her to be more specific, as it turns out what she is describing is not that grandiose at all. It really does not sound that bad, like he may have been mildly delusional but he was not seriously delusional, not like in the psychiatry meaning of grandiose. I realize that my mother does not understand very much at all, indecipherable three words had she had this important piece of information which is very useful to me. I ask her something like, why did she never tell me, why did she let me think for all these years that my father wanted to die, that he committed suicide, and she cannot really say why she let me have the wrong impression, she cannot really answer. It's strange, it was only because he was in the wrong kind of car that he died, it was some kind of car that he did not know how to drive, so he was stuck there. And I also think, mmm, that, in a way, has a legacy of its own, like what Camus used to say about the absurdity of life, and what Harold used to teach us, about catastrophe theory, and about how crazy life is in general, because it seems almost ironically humorous or allegorical that my father died because of a car that was one type instead of another, like a story that shows just how absurd life is, that kind of story also has a legacy. But it is a legacy I can live with better than the one about how he so much wanted to die. Life is kind of crazy, and unpredictable, and you have to be able to have a kind of humor about it, not the humor of denial or running away, but the sad humor of understanding, like a sad smile, to say, yes, yes, that is just how life is, and it can never be comprehended, but at least we are deep enough to recognize it and to see that there is not really an answer. except like that poem about how if there is any answer, oh, how does it go.\n",

      "I am traveling on a bus or train, or maybe in a car with another person. Linda Sird is around; she has now gotten into her 5th or 6th year of a Ph. D. program in Clinical Psychology and she is trying to give me some feedback about my behavior there. She keeps saying We, We, and I realize that this means that a lot of people there must have been talking about me. So I ask her, What do you mean by We, and she answers something like My sister and I, and I suspect this is not true. But she goes on to give some different, confrontive, but true feedback about my behavior, and it is disturbing and hard to hear. . Earlier, I was at a party and I started yelling at people there, just yelling and screaming, and someone there accused me of being drunk, and I breathe into his face and say, I have not had even 1 drink! I almost never drink, and when I do I only have 1 or 2 drinks, and tonight I have not had any drinks! to kind of show him that I'm not just drunk. But as I finish my tantrum and storm out the door I realize that my behavior is borderline and I recall something about the diagnosis of borderline and I realize that I fit that diagnosis. That bothers me. . Later I am traveling in a bus or car or something and this midget keeps trying to cling to the vehicle and to maybe even get in the vehicle, like to climb in, and at first it seems kind of harmless but then it really starts to seem scary, like I do not know what he will do, how far he will go, would he really get inside the car, ishe going to cling to the car the whole way, is he dangerous, etc. It seems that he is a hungry beggar and he wants bread, he wants us to throw him some pieces of bread, we do so, to appease him, to propitiate him, but he does not seem satisfied, he is hungry and wants more, and he seems insatiable. Then I start to get annoyed, like Enough is enough! I start to yell at him to leave us alone, cut it out, stop it, etc. but he is clinging and will not let go, he is so insistent. He is like one of those munchkins in the Wizard of Oz, a little midget or munchkin. Now I am yelling at him but he still will not stop. So I tell Linda to drive really fast, as she starts to drive really fast, I am thinking if this will release him, cause him to let go, but it doesn't, he just keeps holding on, even when we are moving really fast. I want to dislodge him but we can't, he just keeps holding on, he's so damn stubborn and tenacious. Much more than I would have imagined. Linda is having to drive so fast that it scares me but he's still holding on, demanding bread, he wants us to throw him more bread, and not scraps, whole pieces, he is so demanding. Give me more, more, more, and other such things. . I get scared thinking maybe he can really hurt us. .\n",

Colorado Ellen Rome, I am in Colorado, Denver, I am near some kind of parking lot, it is daytime, I see Ellen Rome walk by, I think she is holding Charlie's hand, she has long, thick hair, but not as long as when she was younger, but her hair looks almost exactly the same as when she was younger, in fact, she looks as if time stood still, she looks the same age as she was back then. I am kind of surprised to see her, and I say something like, Ellen! but she just looks at me like I'm crazy and keeps on walking, she does not recognize me at all, and somehow this surprises me, because I kind of thought she would, but then I realize that that does not really make sense since I know I'm in Denver and wanted to see her but she has no idea I'm in Denver and she'd have no way of realizing who I am. It looks like she might be concerned for the little boy, like as if she'd afraid I might be some kind of kook or something. They keep walking, and as they are walking away I again say something like Hi, but she again looks at me like I'm weird, she's still got Charlie by the hand, they get in a car and start to drive away, I think to myself, Oh, I should not have just relied on a chance encounter, I should have structured it, should have told her I was coming to Denver, should have set the whole thing up so that we could have seen each other and been assured of talking to each other. She looks about 15 years old. I am getting closer and I am not giving up. I will remember. I will remember. I will remember. I think, Oh, the fact that she still has long hair is a good sign, she looks like she might be a feminist or even a lesbian, so there still might be a chance to convince her to share with me whatever she knows. She knows something. She knows something. She is going to get in touch with me soon.\n",

      "Steven Mitchell. comes to my house or apartment. I am still living with my mother. We are trying to go out to dinner. I compliment him on his paper from the conference, and mention that I'd just seen it in Psychoanalytic Psychologist. He thanks me. He can see how pathological my family system is. He can see things in my apartment that, if he is paying attention, would make him realize that I am not straight. the books, the statues of women, the images of women. Any fool can see that I love women. But then again, he can also see that I have a sexual energy that can attract, and be attracted to, men, that I can have a sexual power with men, men like me, and sometimes rarely I like men it used to be more, in a way he can even see. LaRue had called me and left a message on my answering machine. She left a message on my machine. I think, I would not want Steven Mitchell to be. If he were not three indecipherable words because if he maybe believed all those 5 indecipherable words also, he is not cute, he is ugly, and I could never be attracted to him, I tell my mother, do not erase the part of LaRue's message that tells, the part I did not hear, because I still want to hear it, my mother rewound my machine, I tell her are you sure, because on my machine if you press rewind it erases, it erases as it rewinds. I am trying to hide from Steven Mitchell how pathological my family system is including me, but it cannot be hidden because my mother keeps making it obvious in various ways, like the way she talks to me, the way she tells me what to do, yells at me, etc. Any fool could see that she is hard to live with. Impossible! Yet real. She is both impossible but real, like Houdini, Harry Houdini, who finally died a real death, in a box that did not just disappear but vanished into thin air, she will vanish, then what will I be left with, myself, only myself and it is almost Christmas and I still have not done my Christmas shopping.

      "I am at a movie theatre, about to see a movie, when suddenly I see on a counter, against the back wall of the theatre, photocopies of a newspaper article which, as it turns out, is about my mother's mother, my grandmother Eva. There is a photo of her there in the article, she looks like my mother. The article says that she was an heiress, and that her 140,000 trust, which had been in existence her whole life oh, it's about my mother Helen had just been depleted, the last dollar had just been spent, and it was like, somehow, the end of an era. When I see it, I think, Oh, that explains why my mother has been so depressed about the end of the money, it's like the last remaining thing she has of her mother, the last remnant, the last tie, to her mother, so when that account is closed in a way she has to say goodbye to her mother. So it sheds a new light on it, in a way. At the same time, I am also very very surprised, because I never, ever knew that my mother had been an heiress in the first place, she had kept this information from me, she'd never mentioned it. And the article says something about the family of Harry Steinberg, how Eva married into the family of Harry Steinberg, and the implication somehow was that it was Harry's family that had the fortune, i. e. that somehow by marrying into Harry's family she became an heiress. I am also very surprised that this article happens to be here at all, like I think it's an amazing coincidence that I go to see a movie with my mother and brother and by chance there is an article here about my mother's mother! People in the audience seem interested in the article, like they are coming up and taking copies of it. Now we are sitting in the audience, waiting for the film to begin, me, my mother, and Mark are there. It is supposedly just some general film, but when the film comes on, lo and behold it's about Helen Redacted Surname! It's all about her life. that's what the film is about. It's about her childhood. It's all about her childhood, like the film is a biography of Helen, Eva, and Harry. I think it is mostly about Eva. The film shows how it was that Eva came to be rich and famous. It shows how she worked as some sort of agent, but as it turned out, not as a travel agent as I had always known her to be, but as an insurance agent or a stock agent or some combination thereof, what happened was she started out being a relatively obscure, little. known agent, but then she did a good job for some people or she helped some people or made contact with some people or something, and these people were famous, and one thing led to another, and she became like the agent of the stars, like an agent who was known and used by well. known people, she started to move somewhat in different circles, although it was also always eminently clear that she was from a different class, that she was not one of them, but anyway, somehow through this process, through moving in these circles and having these contacts, Harry Steinberg comes along and sweeps her off her feet, something like a handsome prince. I can see all this on the film, on the movie screen. I can see Harry, a young, handsome man, I think he is dressed in a white suit, he looks like a prince. type of man, and he comes in to some sort of area where Eva Lesnick is, I think it's a dance hall, it looks like the ball in Cinderella, and kind of sweeps her off her feet, so to speak. Then somehow on the screen there is a picture of Helen, as a little girl, around 3 years old, maybe 2, quite young, she has not yet learned to speak, this is before she had the power of words. And she is trying to communicate something, but it is not clear what she's trying to communicate, since she cannot speak. She has a bottle, and she is shaking the nipple of the bottle up and down, and at the same time somehow I understand that she is trying to communicate something about her father, something that happened when she was 3, maybe even 2, but I think it was 3, and suddenly it hits me, it dawns on me, that it must be something to do with a penis, with her father's penis, that was very traumatic for her, like she must have either seen her father masturbating. which is the kind of gesture she seems to be doing with the nipple on the bottle by waving it up and down like this, or she saw his penis, or he waved it at her, maybe not her father, could have been a stranger too, someone. Anyway, it's definitely clear that the 3. year. old Helen is trying to communicate with the nipple of the bottle by simulating something that happened with a penis. Anyway. so we are sitting there watching this movie and I signal something to Mark, like Oh, do you see what that means, do you recognize that signal. Anyway. somehow it becomes discovered that my mother, whom the film is partly about since it's about her mother Eva, is actually in the audience, people in the audience want to switch off the film for a minute and hear from my real mother. So they do that, they switch off the film, someone in the audience shouts something like Hey, the real Helen Steinberg is here in the audience, Eva's daughter! Let's hear from her a few words! Let's hear from her! The film is shut off and my mother stands up, she looks the way she does now in real life, only even older and more fragile and vulnerable, I feel compassion for her, for the first time I really feel compassion for her, Anyway, she stands up and she speaks about loss, she says something like I've had three losses in my life, the first is when my father died, the second is when my mother died, and the third is when I lost this fortune; I am kind of surprised that she does not mention my father, that she does not say it was a loss for her when he died, but I realize that a part of her was probably relieved when he died, and that she'd never really completely let go with him or trusted him or opened up to him anyway, a part of her had always been self. protective with him, even after 20 years of marriage, and I realized that my father's death was no great loss to her, she just went on with her life, she did not really miss him or struggle with living without him, she just went on, but at the same time I realize that she did have losses, not so much my father but her father, and her mother, that these were really hard for her and have really affected her, and now the loss of the money, too, which is kind of like the end of an era. Anyway, as my mother is speaking I say something to my brother like, She did not say anything about Dad. Somehow neither he nor I are particularly surprised, we are just kind of taking in the information. When she is finished speaking there is a sense that everyone in the audience can feel for her, has compassion for her, she seems so human.\n",

      "I do not want to write this dream down, I do not want to write this dream down. Bob Rome, Joan Rome, involved in satanic cult worship. No, do not be silly. Bob Rome, but he looks a little like my father. It's scary. He is staring at me in a sexual way, desirous way, I do not want it, I am only 4 years old. Let's see. I am at a conference in Philadelphia, National Association of Poetry Therapy; the conference ended Saturday night but I have Sunday free. I already went all the way back to someplace, New York I guess, and there were messages on my answering machine from NAPT people sending me their best regards, and little bottles of hand cream and botty body sic lotion like they have in hotels, all from folks at NAPT. So it seems like it must be over, the conference is over and it's time to go on with normal life. But I think, No, no, that's false, that's a falsehood, that's a pretense, like pretending to go on after my father died, it's not real. No, I have to go back. I have to go back to the Rome's house. But I do not want to. Anyway, they live in Baltimore now. I'm scared to go there. But I go there, in my car I drive up there. Lila, Lila; in my car I drive up there, Charlie Rome was around, he is grown now, tall, grown. up. I go inside the house. No, I remember now, the Romes and a bunch of their friends are all sitting around outside. I notice that they're all outside when I drive up there; at first I think, Oh, I will not go in there, I'll just leave, but then I think, yes I will. I think, Oh, I'll go in and visit with them a little. My nipples hurt. Stop it. I go to sit with them all a little outside. There are a bunch of people there, and a lot of babies, a fair number of babies. At first I think the babies must be those of the younger generation but somehow it comes out that these babies are babies of Joan Rome presumably, of Joan and Bob I guess, even though Joan is already old. And it turns out that after they take care of the babies for a little while, a certain number of months, they pass them on to be adopted by various people. It's something connected with the cult, like a birth cult type of thing, or bizarre way of thinking, like have babies for the cult, or like only respect a woman who has a lot of babies, brainwashing, whatever. Before I put all that together, it just seems like they are ordinary conventional people who like having babies around. Bob Rome knows, he knows, he did something to me, he knows it. Anyway, I sit with them outside a while, they ask me what I'm doing in town, I tell them a little about poetry therapy, I try to explain to them the basic concept. Then I decide to leave; but when I get in my car and am about to leave, I think, No, this is not complete; I have not really revisited this, I need to see the whole house, otherwise I will never get better, with Lila. I think, Ok, I need an excuse to go back in, I need to see the master bedroom and the bathroom in order to remember. So I think, Hey, the door's open and they're all sitting outside, I'll just go back in and check out the rooms I want to see and if they wonder why I'll just pretend I want to use the bathroom before heading on the road trip back to New York. It's only 2 hours, I told them earlier, only 2 hours, so they will not think I made a special trip here just to see them. that would be too obvious. You look good enough to be raped. Anyway, I go back inside and after a quick glance at the bedroom, or maybe I do not even bother looking there, I go in to the bathroom and sit in the bathtub, it is a big tub. Bob Rome is fat, he's fat. Anyway, I think to myself, I am going to sit here in this tub and see if it triggers my memory of having been sexually abused when I was four years old. I sit in the tub and suddenly Bob Rome comes in or walks by; he looks at me, he sees me, he knows, he knows I know, he is evil, Joan Rome is evil, they are weird people, they are involved in some kind of weird cult, weird weird weird weird weird. My nipples hurt. I want to die. Oh, I just remembered another part. Outside the bathroom, somewhere near where the people are all sitting, there is like a voodoo doll, at least it's a doll with pins stuck in it, there are pins stuck in it all over; and when I see it I realize they must be into voodoo, and I realize that that's kind of a way I could broach the subject of cults with them, so I say something like, Oh, so you're into voodoo? and Joan Rome acknowledges that they are, as if it's the most natural thing in the world that a white middle. class couple on Hartman Rd. should be practicing voodoo on little children.\n",

      "1. Mother, I always loved him even more in the stairway, where I had to wake up. Kees. is dying of a brain tumor. He has, I think, 3 tumors, one of which is on his chest area or upper body area, leaving it discolored, a kind of black. I just saw him about 3. 7 weeks ago and he was fine. At that time I was with the Whites Dale, Latitia, Stacy, Natasha and we all saw Kees. I did not think I'd see him again for a long time but now suddenly I've run into him. This is in Israel or Holland somewhere, somewhere near the area of Nive Shalom only there is a beach nearby Katowice, I was with some sort of tour group; there was an open beach cart like the kind we used to take to Ein Carmel beach that I just hopped on, I did not know where it was going, when I found it was going to a far. away beach, at first I wanted to get off because I did not feel like straying that far, but then I decide to stay on. When I get to the beach, far across the beach, I see someone who looks like Kees. Then I realize it is Kees. I go over to him, there is a woman nearby ministering to him whom at first I think is Loes but then it turns out she's not Loes, I do not know who she is. He is dying, he and I both know he is dying, he does not look good, but he does not look quite so bad either, i. e. he does not look like he is dying; there is a powerful connection between us. I sit with him. Some people pass by. Gillian comes by and I introduce him to Gillian, and seeing the two of them together there I realize that he kind of looks like Gillian, they kind of look alike; My mother walks by and I introduce him to my mother; he had seen Dale and Tish several week ago and I'm glad he saw them. I am thinking, or saying to him, I'm glad you had a chance to meet all these people who were important in my life, Gillian and etc. and Hena, but then I realize that he did not actually ever get to meet Hena. I want to talk with him openly about the fact that he's dying. I want to ask him if he's afraid. I lean over him and my hair is soft and dangling around his face like a soft curtain. I wonder if perhaps it reminds him of longing for my mother's hair. and he says I love you, and he says it in a very intense, profound way, and I know he means it. Soon after that his mother and father and I think, two sisters and a brother come by in a kind of van and they are being a little inappropriate to the situation, like they are singing and dancing a little like gypsies, I think they might be in denial, or maybe this is just how they cope with his impending death. I can tell he is a little dismayed. Soon after that Loes arrives, I do not know if she is with Arjan or not. There is a warmth between us, we can relate to what each other is going through. I think, Gee I guess one should never really say 'I wish I could trade places with so and so', because you never really know how things stand till you see how things turn out later on. So just accept where you are!' Kees is so real in the dream, so real, so intense, so alive. I know that running into him on the beach like this, at such a moment, is not just coincidence. It is the universe, trying to bring us to completion, which is one of God's major tasks. Kees understands that too. He looks a tiny tiny bit like my brother. I put two and two together now and think, Gee, last time I saw him at the Leiden ASD conference, I guess he looked emaciated. too thin. not healthy. but it never occurred to me that he could have a serious illness. I should have guessed and judged the situation, then I could have known those were my last moments with him. The vehicle that took us to the beach wants to go back now. Yet I want to spend another 10 or 15 minutes with Kees. I tell them I'll take a taxi back in 10 or 15 minutes, the tour leader gives me a shpiel about how they're responsible for me, they cannot let me stay here alone, etc. , I tell them, look, I traveled around the world independently for three years, I think I can handle taking a 10. minute taxi ride; finally she arranges that one contingent from among those who came will wait 10 or 15 minutes. Kees mentions that he'd written me some letters and packages when this happened, but I never received them. He also sent a letter to the Whites in South Africa. Earlier in the dream, near the very beginning, I was sitting in a circle with people from Wilgespruit, and Dale was doing his indeciph. and speaking very powerfully, almost like talking in tongues or at least being inspired by God, I think, he is a real priest, he has contact with the higher realms. I think at one point Stacy Natasha or Tish interrupts him for second but he makes it clear that when in prayer like this he is not to be interrupted. He channels something about the fact that Kees is ill, seriously ill. I think this scene is around Nive Shalom. Laila and some of the other children Adi are around. Kees wants me to stay with him a while, he'd prefer not to be alone. He reminds me a little teeny bit of Mark. In some ways it seems like he is more connected with me than with his own wife and child, or with his parents. When Loes comes it's a little easier to leave him but still very hard, I wake up from the anxiety.\n",

      "1. Somewhere in or near Bangladesh, or at least there are some Bengali people around. Hena is sitting around, and I think Hena's sister and brother. in. law Nina and Gorjon and some others whom I do not know. One of the people sitting around this table with us is a woman whom I find very beautiful. There is a book by Adrienne Rich on the table, along with several other books, and she comments something about that there is a really nice poem in this book. I get the feeling that it may be an erotic poem, a poem about love between two women. I feel even more drawn to this woman when I hear that she is moved by poetry. I want to know her. However, she is unknowable, I cannot seem to know much more than this, I simply cannot seem to know more. So some potential that could be there between us is not fully realized. We also, the group of us, talk about being Moslem and what it means to be Moslem. I try to say something about how in Bangladesh, in Hena's generation, there are many people who are Moslem by birth and ethnicity who do not practice the Moslem religion. Hena says something to disagree with me, and I am surprised since this is so obviously true. I think the place where we are sitting is about four hours' drive from Eilat or somewhere in Israel. I got here by bus. I have to leave after a relatively short while but I tell myself that perhaps I could come back, since it is only a 4. hour bus ride from Israel, but then I kind of doubt that I really will come back, all things considered, after I move on from here. The table we are sitting around is round, it is the shape of a circle. There were other poetry books on the table too, which we did not get to talk about, some were by poets I had not heard of before. a whole stack of them.\n",

      "3. I go back to my mother's house on Ormond St. There is a Hispanic family living there now, and most of the neighborhood is now Hispanic. There is something that I need to take from this house, something that I very much need to take from my mother's house, that used to belong to my mother, and that I now want to claim as my own because it is mine. In order to get this object, I need to go up on the roof. The roof is shaped in a slantdiagonal, so it is kind of hard to keep one's balance up there, but I have to do this. At first I wanted to go in the house rather than on the roof but the rest of the house was all closed up, the windows were closed and boarded up and the door was closed and it seemed here was no way to get in and no way to see what was going on inside, solid and impenetrable and not seeable or knowable, completely untransparent. the only way I can get what I need is to go up on the roof and take it from there. I think what I need from up there might be some kind of musical instrument such as a piano, or a radio, or a table, or some kind of contraption, I'm not sure really what it is I need up here, but whatever it is I seem to need it badly and to be determined to get it. As I am struggling to get this object from up here, the woman who lives in the house now, this Hispanic woman, somehow sees what I am doing and jumps to the conclusion that I am some kind of thief trying to steal something from her and her family's house. She yells something at me about what am I doing up here. I answer back that I used to live in this house, and that this object belongs to my mother, and I want it back, it is time for me to take it back, so many years have gone by and I want my object back, I want my mother's object back, I want what is mine and what is ours. I am pulling and lifting and trying and struggling, but it is very hard to have the object break loose from its attachment to this house. It is like stuck here, but I want to break it loose and take it with me, yet without damaging the object. I think about how I would like for my mother to come with me to this house and show me around sometime soon. I would like for her to take me on a tour of the inside, which I cannot see now from the outside, show me what is inside her childhood house, all the memories and experiences and images there that she carries inside her now. The Hispanic woman who was very suspicious of me actually seems to be letting me continue, letting me be here on the roof doing what I am doing. So I keep working at it, keep trying to break the object loose of the house on Ormond St. and take the object with me to my own house.\n",

      "4. I am in Bethel, at NTL. I have gone there for the 50th anniversary celebration. I am somewhere in the main area or perhaps in an area near Don Coverdale's house. There is a man here who has just arrived, not long before I did. Somehow he had some kind of serious accident, I do not know if it was a car accident or some other kind of accident, I think he may have been injured in a scuba diving accident, and it looks like he is dead. His head is about 34 severed from his body, so it looks pretty hopeless. And at first it feels like there is almost no pulse or heartbeat. But then I andor someone else with me hold together the top part of the body and the bottom part of the body, we hold the two parts together, and when we hold them, press them, together like that, we notice that he is in fact still alive, that his heart is. miraculously!. still beating. I put my hand against his chest and find that not only is his heart still beating, it is thumping, it is thumping fairly hard. I start to feel a little bit of hope, even though it looks like this is against the odds since the top part of his body is 34 severed from the bottom part of his body, but it's definitely worth a try now to resuscitate him. We kick into action like we did at the Weirlab in Andros. JulieQuest is around, I think Rad is around, and several others. Alisa Dennis is around but for some reason she is not helping. She is being rather sullen and is not participating or helping with us, and I am angry at her. As we are all trying hard to save this man, I keep thinking of Uma and the whole situation reminds me so much of what happened with Uma, and at times I even mistake Uma's name for this man's name. As we are holding together the two halfs of his body which were severed and trying to resuscitate him, at a certain point his body starts to move as if to a rhythmic beat of music, it is almost as if he is trying to move or to dance and when we hold his body together he is still able to. I think, and maybe even say, maybe we should put on the Grateful Dead, because it seems that this man loved the Grateful Dead, and I am thinking that maybe when he hears the Grateful Dead he will really start to come alive again, kick, move, get his strength and vitality back, etc. The song I thought of humming or that was on my mind. Sunshine Daydream. Though I am also aware that it's kind of ironic to mention a group called The Grateful Dead at a time like this, i. e. when we are working so hard to bring him back to life and to keep him alive. Besides, I think that the music might interfere with our need to be able to communicate with each other during the resuscitation. I shout a few times to Alisa for help but she basically refuses to be involved in the resuscitation effort or help. Other people, however, do, and there is a good amount of teamwork and collaboration in order to save this man's life. Even though it seems virtually impossible that his heart could still be thumping when his body has been 34 severed from his head, I think to myself, Well, this must be a man who really wants to live, who has an unusually strong drive toward life, life. drive, much stronger than the average person's, a very strong compelling desire to live, life. force, life. energy, will to live, very very compelling and powerful, enough to defy logic or prediction. This man is Bill Ressler, or someone who is just like Bill Ressler, and I recall from the days of the 10. day course that he did indeed have a strong life. force in him. energy, strength, vitality, passion, will to live. I am trying to focus on leadingdirecting the psychologicalinterpersonal parts of the resuscitation effort, like telling people you do this, you do that, encouraging JulieQuest, encouraging people not to give up, to have hope to keep trying, to stay motivated, keep working, etc. and Julie is doing most of the actual CPR, or is about to, and at a certain point she asks me if I also know how to do CPR in case she gets tired, at least the part about breathing, i. e. do I know how to breathe into another person, I mention that I learned how many years ago I am thinking of the course I took at Camp Tevya but that I would not remember how to do it today, and that I would not want to take a chance on doing it wrong. JulieQuest seems to feel that like it or not, I might have to. , i. e. if she really gets tired and needs a break. JulieQuest is a little slow in starting the CPR, a little hesitant, and I have to encourage her, remind her that time is of the essence, remind her that it's not hopeless, that his heart is thumping but his injury is quite serious so it's extremely important that we institute the CPR in order to keep his heart pumping blood through his body and keep his heart working properly, keep his heart working and the blood flowing, or he will die. JulieQuest, it's important! You must! Begin now, please, begin, do not wait, do not hesitate, we must try, there is a chance, there is still a chance that we can save him and we must try. I keep thinking of Uma, flashing back to Uma's death, wishing that we could have saved Uma too. but we can only save the living life is for the living. we cannot save the ones who have already died poor Uma, however much we long to, like in triage, we must focus our efforts on the ones who have a chance however small to stay alive, and nurture that chance, build on that chance, strengthen that chance, increase that chance. life is for the living, and this man has a chance of being revivedstaying alive, being kept alive, if we can keep the top part of his body connected with the bottom part of his body, if we can keep the two parts together, if we can hold him together until he is restored, until he comes back to life, until he is healed, until he is well, until he is strong. jagged line, the line where he was severed is a jagged line. When I first got there, I was confused about where everyone was and what I had missed, rushing around trying to find everyone. Later, when this thing happens, I think maybe I was meant to be in exactly this place at exactly this time so that I could help save this man's life. Earlier. when I first got to the NTL thing, there was a staircase that looks like a kind of spiral staircase. And all along the staircase, as you wind around from step to step, on each step is some object associated with the history of NTL or with a person from NTL. At a certain point as I am slowly making my way through the steps I ask someone who helped to organize this whole thing he is a man around in his 50s or 60s, slightly feminine voice, from California I think, who has been very active in NTL. reminds me of a guy who was active in ASD whom I saw at the Dreams conference, in fact I think it is that guy, Stan Krippner, anyway, I ask him if there's anything here that belonged to Jack Gibb or that's about Jack Gibb or is associated with Jack Gibb, and he says yes and points to a step near me where there is a small exhibit that was given by Jack Gibb's family that came from Jack's house, one of Jack's special possessions, I'm not sure what it is but it looks like part of it is like those beautiful delicate animals made of hand. blown glass, a little glass animal, hand. blown, and I think there may be a round mirror at the bottom, it may rest on a little round mirror, or on a little circle of transparent glass, transparent glass almost like a pond, that has reflective properties. But I am not sure what this object is or how to interpret or understand it, and I wish Jack were here so I could ask him. What's important to me, however, is that it belonged to Jack, and so to me, regardless of what it is supposed to be or represent, it is precious, simply because it belonged to Jack and he donated it to this exhibit. The man that I asked the question asks me, did you know Jack? and I say Yes, Jack was my mentor. for the work I did at International College. I pause before adding the International College part so that I am emphasizing that he was my mentor in a more general way. A few minutes later, I wonder if perhaps Jack could still be alive, maybe he is not really dead, and for a few moments I actually have myself almost believing that's possible, but then I remember that this man said did you know Jack?, and I realize that if Jack were still alive he would have asked me do you know Jack? rather than did you know Jack? Then I also recall seeing the phrase In memoriam in the NTL brochure. I feel sad that Jack died just a couple of years before this event, I wish that I could have seen him here once more. But if he's dead two years already, there's nothing I can do about it, I cannot bring him back to life, I have to accept it, life is for the living. Much earlier, I saw Alisa and we got in a big fight, there was a lot of tension between us, now I am worried that the black women at the conference will take her side simply because she's black and will think the fight had something to do with my being white and will not want to have anything to do with me. She is not behaving toward me as a friend should behave. A part of me thinks, Oh, we'll get through this just like we've gotten through so many other things in our friendship, and a part of me thinks no, this is different, this time there is really a chance that our friendship will not continue. I think about how even at the peak of our friendship, for example when I wrote her a card on Andros, I acknowledged that there was always the chance that a day would come when we are no longer close friends, no longer an active part of each other's lives.\n",

      "1. something about Beatrice, about the mythical hero Beatrice. Somebody who has a book about her tells me something like that she came into being as a hero when she was 12, that she was born as a hero at age 12. When I hear this, I feel very interested and perked up and moved because I suddenly feel very connected with her, I feel that she is like me and I am like her, something about Odysseus and the Odyssey, something about the epic journey, something about heroism, something about that when I was 12 my own journey started, journey in wisdom, into knowledge about life, into all the hard places a person must pass through in order to become wise. So when I hear about the heroine Beatrice and how her own journey started at 12, I feel we have something in common. Something about Minnie Bruce Pratt and her Beatrice, she's connected too, we are all. Homer's Beatrice, Minnie Bruce's Beatrice, I. connected to each other.\n",

      "1. A dream about Kees. he is so vivid. so vivid to me, so vivid. It's as if he visited me in my sleep. so incredibly alive and vivid. I am somewhere with Hena, I think in or around New York. She looks the way she looked in that picture of her with the nightgown on. She is sleeping now, and is going to be leaving to go back to Bangladesh in a couple of days, like around the day after tomorrow. Somehow I talk to someone in Washington, the person I talk to reminds me of Mike Lukesevitch, and I learn that there is a party there, at which there are many people I used to know I think mainly people from Worcester, the Worcester crowd and I feel really bad that I'm not there. Then I also hear that Kees is in Washington, just for a day or so, then he'll be going back to Holland, and I really wantneed to see him, so Hena is sleeping, and I do not want to wake her, besides I do not really think she'll want to come just to go for this party and then come back on one day, so I leave her and I drive to Washington, I go to some sort of party there. I'm not sure whether this is the same party I just heard about in the first phone call that was a Worcester. type party or some other party, a different party. At the party, at one point I am sitting on a fairly large bed and sitting or lying there with me are Gillian and Kees and Jerry Koocher. this was mostly a lesbian party in the phone call about the Worcester. type party, that was another thing. I think it was Thom Fitzgerald. told me that it was mostly lesbians, a lesbian. type party, a party with a lot of the lesbians I used to know. so maybe this is indeed the party I am at now, the one he told me about a while ago Earlier, even with all the lesbians that are here, when I hear that Kees is here I very much long to be with Kees. I want him. I look around and I find Kees and when we see each other he is happy to see me too. he looks kind of like he did in China when we first met, in 1982 we begin to kiss and kiss and kiss in a beautiful tender and passionate yet gentle way, and we do not go further e. g. into sex but the kissing, which we do for a fairly long while, is a lot like making love. I feel so much for him. the feeling is strong. So we are kissing and kissing like that. Then, at some point a little later, we are on the bed and Gillian and Jerry Koocher are there, and a few other people. And the other people have already introduced themselves to us and one another a short while ago. Suddenly I remember that I should make some introductions. Particularly, I realize, because I want to connect with and impress Jerry Koocher. I say to Jerry, this is Gillian, she's doing her MA in International Relations, she was my lover during the trial, so she knows all about the case, she knows the whole thing by heart, she helped me with my lines, People smile and laugh warmly when I say this. I wanted to mention her degree to impress Jerry with the quality of the people I know. Just before that I had first said to the others there, especially Gillian, This is Jerry Koocher, he was the expert witness in my case against Maryland. then I after I introduce Gillian to Jerry and the others I say to Jerry and the others . but my words are mainly directed toward Jerry, and this is Kees, he is an architect. again, I mention the occupation so as to be more impressive. Jerry asks Kees a few questions that relate to architecture, it seems that the fact that Kees is an architect interests him. Jerry is nice and friendly to the people here, even though he is older and more prestigious than us. I am still being affectionate with Kees, physically, hugging and kissing, etc. , and I kind of want Jerry to see that I'm not so much a lesbian anymore, that I am in a love relationship with a man. but I also think that this may confuse him, because he knows me to be a lesbian and he knows Gillian was my lover, so I think he may think I'm fickle, promiscuous, or bisexual, and sometimes that can be the worst thing for someone to think about you. Anyway, at some point during the party I'm not sure whether it's before or after this part Kees reveals that he has builtcreateddesigned some objects here, some art. type, architecture. type, sculpture. type objects. And he says that I can choose one for myself, like I can have one to keep and take home with me. And it is almost a little bit like a game show contestant type thing, where you can choose Door 1, Door 2, etc. , except that you can see the prizes in advance. Here he looks like that picture of him at the restaurant taken in China '82 in which he is standing up alongside the others of us. Anyway, I look at the first two prizes I do not remember what they were and then I see an artwork some kind of creative sculpture using brass, paint, and other media, that looks like a romantic. type, royal. type scene of a doorway into Central Park, like an entrancewaygateway to Central Park, like around the area where the horses and carriages are with a look that is similar in quality, tone and atmosphere to the look of the traditional horse carriages. There is something about the way the picturesculpture there is done that gives it a feeling of royalty and romance. The main structure in the picturesculpture is a door or gateway, and the picturesculpture is designed in such a creative way that the viewer can actually open the door. but before I touch or open the door, just based on the beauty, splendor, grandeur, and majesty of this paintingsculpture, I choose this one over the others, I say I choose this one, the one with the door. Then, after I have chosen it, I realize I can actually open the doorgate and see further into the picture, I open it and I see a dead baby, lifesize, and looking very real. I quickly shut the door and feel horrified, I feel I have made a big mistake. I am horrified and afraid that now that I chose this door I am somehow stuck with having to deal with this dead baby. And another part of the horror, another reason I am horrified, is because of what this means about Kees, like in seeing this I suddenly realize that this suggests. about Kees, like that at one level close to the surface he is romantic and everything looks full of splendor and grandeur, but then on the other level, deeper inside, lurks some kind of cruelty or evil or possibility for the grotesque and macabre. It is like there are aspects of Kees that I had not noticed or acknowledged before, and that scares me almost as much more, perhaps as the baby itself. I close the door quickly and try to back out but I'm not sure if I can back out once I have made my choice. After some time it is time me for me to be heading back to New York, Hena is there and I need to get back and help her get up and get ready to go to the airport, etc. , and she will be worried about whether I am going to get back to take her in time because when I went to the party in Washington I did not leave a note. So she will wonder where I am and what's going on, so I need to get back. I would like Kees to come back with me, because I'm not ready to part from him, I still want to be with him and I have not had a chance to spend enough time with him at this party. So I say something about needing to leave, and I go around to say goodbyes, etc. , and I think that Kees will just automatically want to come with me, accompany me, but now it's not so clear. As it is getting to be time to leave, there is also something about needing to carry the things sculpturesartwork and I help him carry the things, so I say I will help him carry these things, and he ends up giving me one to carry that is made of stone, it's like a stone sculpture, and when I lift it it feels extremely heavy to me, much heavier than I'd thought it would be the picture with the dead baby reminds me a lot of a picture of a dead baby in one of Frida Kahlo's paintings and the sculpture is heavier than I thought it would be. Then it is time for me to drive back to New York, and there is still some question about whether Kees wants to accompany me. Somehow when I see that it's not clear whether he's going to accompany me I also feel that even though we were kissing so passionately and tenderly, maybe he does not really want to be with me after all, maybe his feelings for me are not really as strong or intense as mine and he does not want to be with me so much in the way that I want to be with him. although that is hard to fathom, since when we were kissing he too seemed to feel so much, and to feel deeply. But his reluctancehesitation to accompany me make me question his feelings for me. Anyway. somehow I get back to New York, Hena is sleeping or just waking up, I'm not sure whether I arrive back alone or with Kees, she is wondering where I was and I have to tell her about going to Washington and all, and then it is time to get ready to go to the airport.\n",

      "2. I am at Marty's funeral. The funeral is being held one day after he died. My mother wanted to hold it quickly right away so she could get it over with. I think about the difference between an attitude of wanting to get it over with vs. an attitude of wanting to create a meaningful ceremony and make sure all the friends and family are there and there is time to prepare, and how this would sound if I told Lila, and how she'd understand what I meant about my mother's approach of just getting it over with vs. the other approach. I also think about how when Lila comes back from her vacation tomorrow I have to tell her about all that happened while she was away . even though it was a short time, a lot has happened. Like, that my stepfather has died. I know she is going to be surprised when I tell her that, as well as about the cancer I had have?. Alisa is not here with me. The plans for the funeral were made so quickly that I did not have a chance to call her and tell her what happened. But in any case I am really not certain whether she would have come in for the funeral to support me and be with me anyway, in fact I kind of doubt whether she would. Rabbi Miller is going to give the eulogy. I think about how it's good that he knew Marty personally and spent time on his boat because he can give a eulogy that's really based on knowing him. I think about how the rabbi too must be shocked about Marty's sudden death. I think about how I have, at home, the book I made for my mother's 60th birthday, and how in the book there is a love letter that Marty wrote to my mother, a beautiful letter, and how if I had thought ahead and had more time I would have arranged to read this letter at the funeral service. Likewise with the letter that Marty wrote to Mark. I think about how I could have read portions of it at Marty's funeral service. I think about that I'm lucky he wrote that letter to Mark this year, before he died, because it allowed me to understand a different side of him, and to appreciate him more than I had before. Just before the service, there is like a guest book, and each person who is coming to the funeral is supposed to sign the guestbook. There is a woman who works for the funeral parlor who is monitoring the signing of the guestbook and when I come in to sign my sheet each person has like a separate sheet, she tries to rush me and hurry me and she is quite rude, and I tell her supervisor, is she working for her, and when the supervisor says yes I say she has been very rude to me. The reason it takes me a while to sign the guest. sheet is that I am trying to decide whether to write my last name as Redacted Surname or Redacted Surname Stein. I've listed my first name as Redacted First. Name1'. I know my legal name and the name everyone knows me by is Redacted Surname but only by writing Stein can I also acknowledge and affirm my relationship to Marty and the role of Marty in my life as well as show the mourners here that I have been connected to Marty and that I am a part of Marty's funeral. I struggle with the decision for quite some time but in the end I think I just write Redacted Surname, largely because the lady is rushing me and I do not have enough time to think. The sheets that you write your name on, each one looks kind of like a restaurant placemat. type. thing, you know, like the kind they have in places like the House of Pancakes or Howard Johnson's, covered with plastic laminated, and there are various things underneath the plastic, but because of the plastic lamination it is very hard to write on it, even just to sign it, and that is another reason why it takes a long time. Just before the service was supposed to start, I went to the bathroom, I am sitting on the toilet trying to shit, and it is hard for me to get the shit out, I have to squeeze. As I am doing so, I look over where the toilet paper roll is and suddenly I notice a sign that says something about Jewish people and organizations giving scholarships to black children giving scholarships for black children and somehow something about the way it's worded makes me realize that this building where the synagogue now is this is Temple Mishkan Tefila used to be the Elma Louis Center for the Arts, which was like an arts and cultural center for African American children in Roxbury a long time ago. The signs about the scholarships which indicate that this used to be the Elma Louis Center are kind of old and peeling, it looks like the arts center must have been a long time ago, I recall how I read about the Elma Louis Center in that book I read last year The Destruction of an American Jewish Community and I think that in a way, everything has come full circle. that now I am in this place that I read about in the book, for the purpose of my stepfather's funeral. Meanwhile I'm having a hard time finishing going to the bathroom, and my mother and others want the service to start already. She or someone tells me to hurry up, again I feel rushed, just as I am finishing in the bathroom I do not really get a chance to get all the shit out the organ music for the funeral starts to come on, and I wish they had waited till I was in my seat before they started waited until I had gotten seated adjusted myself in my seat before they started playing the music. There was not enough time to tell everyone who knew Marty what happened, so there are not really as many friends and relatives of Marty as would be here if my mother had waited longer before proceeding with the funeral. I feel sorry for my mother, I think about how she only had 6 years with Marty and how she'll be lonely now, lonely for the rest of her life. She'll be alone now just like she was for a time after Jerry died, after Jerry died, she was also alone, in between the various people you come to know and connect with in life, you are alone, you always come back to yourself. you, moving through life, moving along on the route of growth, are the one constant. This is something existential, and I think about how it applies to my mother in this situation. I see my mother as more of a human being when I see her in this light, as a woman moving through life connecting with different people along the way and then coming back to herself and her solitude. But I know my mother will really miss Marty, she really loved him and she will feel lonely without him and will miss him. As hard as I know it will be for her, somehow I sense she is strong enough to bear it, she will get through it somehow. my mother is a survivor. Earlier. what happened is my mother and Marty and maybe me too are Mom and Marty are swimming in the water, and there is some kind of whirlpool, some kind of big whirlpool looks almost like the black holes that were described to me on Andros, in the Bahamas, and this whirlpool sucks up Marty somehow and kills him. My mother just narrowly escapes. she is very nearby but just misses getting sucked up into the whirlpool. I think there may have been a third person with them too who also gets killed in the whirlpool, but I'm not 100 certain. I think we are on vacation somewhere near Florida. No one expected this to happen. Everybody thought this would just be a brief vacation and then everything would be all right. Nobody thought that the week would end with an irreversible fatality the arrow of time moves forward, the past does not return. Everybody is in shock. nobody thought that a death would occur on this trip.\n",

      "I am to go to some sort of youth prison, on a field trip, it is like a field trip supervised by Umumdnj sic for orientation only it is being led by Janet Nelson that's her name in the dream, but it is Janet Geller, i. e. it is the person of Janet Geller. Beatrice Beebe is also involved with leading the trip, like she too is one of the organizers of the trip. We are all going to be driving there, a bunch of us. And I do not have a car. It's like, everyone has a car except for me, or at least has access to a car. Before the trip, we are somewhere else, we're in some sort of hotel. And we are all scrambling to get going so that we will reach the place on time, or ahead of time, and I am not ready, I'm not ready to go, and I'm rushing around trying to get ready, and there is not enough time, I feel I need more time, but there is only a limited amount of time. Then when we go out to the area where the cars are, it seems like everything will be all right, like Beatrice Beebe says something to me, or is it maybe Janet, but I think it's Beatrice, about stand on the road and wait for her to drive by, maybe at the bottom of a hill?, stand at the place where the road could go in either direction, one way or the other way, the place where the road could go in either direction, she will drive by and pick me up. So I get out of the car and go to stand on the road, at that particular point in the road. The others are driving to the youth prison in like a caravan, several cars, one car after another. Only when I go to wait out on the road, nobody comes to get me, somehow it's like they forget all about me and just keep going, and I am left behind. When I realize that this is what is happening, I feel extremely upset and anxious, and desperate, and I feel that I must join them, meet up with them, that I must get to see this youth prison, and even though I'm not really sure why it's so important to me, like a part of me says to myself Why not just let it go?, I feel intensely, with great anxiety fear and desperation, that I must meet up with them, that I cannot be left behind. I go back into the hotel room where we've been staying. I realize suddenly that I do not have the name of the place we are supposed to be going, I do not have the telephone number or any way to reach the others, and I do not even know the name of the place. But I believe it is somewhere in or near Stockbridge, then I wonder if maybe it could be the Austen Riggs Center, but then I remember that it would not be the Austen Riggs center because it is a youth prison. At one point I get hold of a car myself somehow and I am driving but I'm not sure where I'm going or which way to go, and I see a sign for Woods Hole and I realize I must be near the Cape, and I think of my mother and Marty, and I feel some comfort in knowing that at least I'm near my mother and Marty, and I smile to myself knowing that they are probably on the boat around here, nearby. But somehow trying to drive to this place is not going to work, because I do not know the name of the place, and I do not know which way to go. So then I'm back in the hotel room, frantically trying to reach Janet and the people who have gone ahead. Only it's hard to figure out how to reach Janet since I do not have the telephone number of the place that they went to. I try the operator, directory assistance, trying to get possible numbers for the place where the others could be, I think it is a different hotel I need and I do end up being given two or three different telephone numbers, but none of them seems to be correct, none of them is working or helps me to reach the other people in the group. I am feeling increasingly anxious, fearful and frantic as it appears increasingly unlikely that I will be able to reach them, contact them. While I am trying to use the phone to reach Janet and the others, there are also a few people who try to reach me. One, I think, may be Morris Kaufman. Another is someone who kind of reminds me of Mel Schnapper but it is not Mel, it's some other man, a man who wears glasses. could his name be something like Jerry Levine? but when this person reaches megets through to me, I tell them I cannot talk right now, because my group has left and I need to find them, I need to reach them, I have like two or three different numbers but none of them is working properly to help me reach the rest of the group, I think meanwhile I am thinking that I should not have agreed to get out of the car, I should not have gotten out of the car so willingly, I should not have agreed to just stand in the road because it was predictable that they would pass me by, now I am thinking about it and wondering. why did she pass me by? Did she not see me there? or was she driving so fast that she just could not stop? or did she forget about me, just forget that I needed a ride to join them? The more it seems like I will not succeed in reaching them and not be able to join them, the more terrified and desperate I feel, I feel extremely anxious and frantic. And I am very aware of the passage of time, like all the while that I'm making these efforts to reach them, the clock is ticking, time is passing, and I realize that the visit to the youth prison may be completely over before I have a chance to meet up with them. I am terrified that I'm going to run out of time and it will be too late. Because it's not like this trip will go on forever, it's a time. limited visit, and if I do not meet up with them before it's over then I will not be able to meet up with them at all. I feel such anxiety at being left behind, I feel such a desperate need to meet up with them, and the more time that goes by and the more it seems unlikely that I'll reach them in time, the more frightened, upset and anxious I become.\n",

      "Kees, I see him somewhere in Asia, and we decide to go to Bhutan together. I am happy and excited to be able to finally see this little mountain kingdom I have always heard about and dreamed about seeing. We are together, Kees and I, experiencing this adventure together. I am attracted to him. And I'm excited to be in Bhutan. I think about how I'd like to go back to China someday to retrace my steps from the 1982 trip, but I'm not ready to do so yet, it's still too soon, it would be better to take that trip after I have already seen most of the other countries of the world that I want to see. There is a feeling of excitement on the part of Kees and I, as well as between Kees and I. I cannot believe I'm really in Bhutan! I think of Trish and how I'd like to send her a postcard or letter from this place. At some point later on I'm living in New York and Kees comes to visit me, and we spend some time together in New York. I am living in a different apartment from the one I'm in now. Although I'm happy to see him and be with him, I think about Arjan and how Arjan is only a baby only about 4 months old or so, and how he needs his father, and how in a way it is irresponsible and self. centered of Kees to be traveling around doing what he feels like doing when he has a baby son at home who longs to see his daddy. At one point, when we're still in Bhutan, Kees and I are walking down something like a corridor or hallway, it looks a little bit like a tunnel almost, and Kees says to me even though we're talking about something different at the moment, did you feel your father's presence here just now? Even though that was not what I'd been thinking aboutfeeling in the previous moment, in order to please Kees I say yes. I think Kees is trying to tell me something about the immortality of the soul and about the fact that my father's spirit is still with us and available to us and a part of our lives, of our path, with us, still with us. It is as if Kees knows and understands my father Jerry, and has a relationship with my father, a relationship of two souls intertwined. Kees's presence is vivid to me. He looks like he did in China when we were there in 1982 together, Kees's energy, essence, soul. When we are in New York, and I know we'll be coming back to New York on several other dates in the foreseeable future, I think about giving him a key to my apartment so he can come and go as he pleases, but I want to say something to him about if possible, try to call and let me know you'll be coming because otherwise if I hear someone coming into my apartment with a key and I have not heard in advance that it's going to be you, I might feel scared. Also although I'm glad I'll get to see him in New York on several occasions, I wonder about how Arjan will feel about the fact that his dad is away from him. I feel connected to Kees, and it's clear we are connected. Kees feels connected to my dad even though he never knew him, it's like Kees understands my dad spiritually, and understands the importance of my dad's spirit in my life. The most vivid part is when we are in Bhutan. I am so happy and excited to be in this little mountain kingdom that I always heard about, finally, Bhutan. and with Kees! To be here makes me think of Trish and remember Trish. Kees and I are in Bhutan together, traveling, traveling around like in the old days, just like when we were young. He is vivid to me, as always Kees is vivid to me. And two souls intertwined outdistance . death.\n",

      "3. I am in a hotel room, at some sort of conference. Bev Greene and I have arranged to have dinner together, we are meeting in a little while, and I take off my clothes and am about to go into the shower. It is like around 700 and we are supposed to meet for dinner at 800. I think it is possible we are going to discuss my dissertation. Just when I'm about to go in the shower, my mother comes in, kind of bursts in. I am surprised to see her since as far as I knew she was in Boston and I am four hours away from Boston. She says that she was worried about me and decided to take a drive in to see me and make sure I'm okay. Apparently she persuaded Marty to go along with this and to drive her here while she was a passenger. I am surprised that Marty went along with this. to me that reveals something about how much under my mother's thumb Marty really is. i. e. that he'll do whatever she wants. Anyway, my mother now wants to take me out to dinner, and she expects me to drop everything. my dinner plans with Bev, the rest of the conference sessions scheduled for tonight, etc. and just pay attention to her, be with her, have dinner with her, etc. I do not want to do so, I made plans and it's not fair that she should just burst in unannounced like this. I am torn because on the one hand, I can see how hard she is trying and she really wants to see me and spend time with me and she came a long way, but on the other hand, I do not want to reschedule my dinner with Bev and I do not want to reinforce my mother's behavior. I think about the behaviorist principles I have learned, like about reinforcement and things like that. this leads me to think about how if I am happy to see her or if I go and have dinner with her, then I am definitely reinforcing her behavior in coming here and I am thereby increasing the probability that in the future she will do something like this again. I think about calling Dr. Primavera since he knows a lot about behaviorist principles, or someone else who knows about these matters, and asking for advice about how to proceed and how to balance my need to not reinforce my mother's behavior with my need to not be cruel to her, to have some compassion toward her. There is a special, rather complicated kind of reinforcement schedule that only Dr. Primavera and I and only a few other people are familiar with, that I think may work in this situation, and I want to get some advice about it, I think it's called something like intermittent reinforcement or a variable ratio schedule. I am also thinking about the fact that I am supposed to meet Bev Greene any minute now and I have not yet taken a shower because of my mother's coming here unexpectedly, at the very least I am going to be late for meeting Bev if I'm even able to still go out to dinner with Bev at all. I think about how this will, in her eyes, reflect badly on me and how it will be hard for her to understand what the problem is. I am also afraid that Bev will enter my room at this moment and find my mother here like this and it will be embarrassing to me, especially for Bev to see how my mother infantalizes me. I try to gently but firmly insist to my mother that I have other plans, that she cannot just burst in here like this and expect me to drop everything. But my mother will not take no for an answer, she feels strongly that since she is here and drove four hours to get here, and since she's old and she's my mother, I should drop all my other plans and do what she wants me to do, make her my first priority. She just cannot understand why I would not prioritize her over Bev, and prioritize her over the conference sessions, why I do not just make her 1, my 1 priority, i. e. drop everything else now that she is here. she really cannot understand why I will not do that, and it hurts her not to be my first priority and she cannot understand. I do not want to hurt her but I also cannot go along with the way she just burst in here kind of expecting me to drop everything and serve her needs. Also, her whole idea in coming here in the first place was mainly from her own fantasy, i. e. that there was something wrong and she needs to check on me, rather than some reality. based event. On the other hand she did drive a long way and it does seem so important to her that I spend time with her tonight. So I am feeling torn, and very anxious, and I do not know what to do.\n",

      "2. I am near a house, and I see something happen toward the front of that house, I see a man with a machine gun, there's another man in there too, and it seems . and I'm scared . that the one man is maybe going to shoot the other one, maybe somehow I am going to get killed here too, like caught in the cross. fire or something. So, I have like a moment in which to act, I'm out front sitting in the guy's the guy whom I'm afraid will get killed car or limousine it's a fancy, very expensive type of car so I jump into the driver's seat, the keys are in the car or I have them, and I step on the gas and start to drive . in order to save my life. I do think, for a moment, about how by doing this taking his car, I may be dooming the other man to be killed, i. e. because I am taking away his best may be 'last' chance of escape, but I also think . Well, in moments like these, that are life. or. death, you have to be to be willing to be selfish and just seize the moment, go for it, and act to save your life. But I do hope the guy finds some way to save his life that does not depend on this car. Now I am afraid, terrified. I am afraid that the guy with the gun will come after me and kill me. so I'm driving as fast as I can, but then after a few minutes I start to realize. I cannot just drive. that increases the chance that he'll find me. I have to drive somewhere. to some sort of place or location. But I do not know where I can turn to for help, or who would care may be 'dare' to help me in a situation like this. Meanwhile I am driving very fast, and I am terrified that he'll come after me and find me. After a while I notice that I am in Newton, like somewhere in the general vicinity of Dudley Rd. , like the general wide area or neighborhood I grew up in. And I start to think. who can I turn to here? Where can I turn? and I cannot think of anyone to whom I can turn. Then I think. Well, I am not too far from the Podolsky's house, maybe Dave Podolsky, I do think. Well, I could turn to my mother but I do not know where she is so I think I'll try to get to Dave Podolsky's house, but I'm afraid that wherever I go I may be turned away. Somehow as I keep driving I'm now in a somewhat different neighborhood, in this neighborhood there are somea few mansions, and I run inside this mansion, it looks like there is some kind of party or something going on in here now, there's a fair number of people in there. Anyway, I run inside this mansion, and I decide that what I need to do is call the police and ask for protection, and I feel like this is a good idea. I am pleased with this idea. So I find a phone and I call 911. Meanwhile, the other people in this house are enjoying themselves, enjoying themselves, not realizing the mortal danger we are in and not noticing how frantically and desperately I'm trying to get the police to help me. indeciph. so I dial 911, a woman answers, and I realize that I do not know where I am. I do not know my location. I have not got a clue as to where I am except that it's in Massachusetts somewhere. so I say to her, Please operator. please, this is not a joke, I need the police, I need police protection, please trace the call, please trace this call immediately, and send the police out here. one man may have killed another with a machine gun, and that man is going to come after me any minute, my life is in danger. please trace the call and come. But the operator does not seem to take what I am saying seriously. she seems rather skeptical or excessively nonchalant. She asks me a few questions about. where I am, cannot I try to figure out where I am? I look to the people near me at this party, and try to think indeciph. , and suddenly I see my mother is here. Tell me, where are we? I ask. Are we in Newton, and where in Newton we are, I know we must be in Newton because I was on Dudley Rd. and could not have gotten too far from there. My mother says No. we are in Malden. I say to the operator, Well, we may be in Malden. please, just trace the call, we do not have much time. But then someone says something indeciph. looks like either 'like we are' or 'that makes me realize we are' not in Malden. indeciph. line something about the area reminds me of Jamaica Estates in Queens. Large mansions and that type of thing. Then suddenly something about how this area looks indeciph. looks like 'seems' very connected to Mattapan, and I ask someone at the party. Are we in Mattapan? And he or she says yes. and I realize that we are only a few blocks from the house where my mother grew up on Ormond St. Even though her neighborhood was more working classlower middle class, apparently there was an area not far from there still in Mattapan indeciph. looks like 'where some people' have mansions. So I say what I know to the operator, i. e. I tell her. please, please trace the call, please send for police protection! She is very reluctant to help me, I guess because she does not really understand that this is very serious, she does not indeciph. looks like 'feel' or 'think' that there's real danger, she thinks I'm exaggerating or making it up or something. Then, before the police come, sure enough the two men arrive, the one with the machine gun and the one he was going to kill, I'm afraid now that something bad will happen. indeciph. and the people at this party are so naive, just relaxing and having a good time, that they do not realize that they are in danger. Somehow, I end up having a machine gun in my hands. I do not know how I got it, indeciph. line or what. and I indeciph. the bad guy. and somehow because of my actions, tragedy is averted, I conquer over this bad guy, and in the end I am like a hero, like a superhero, in everyone's mind. I saved the day. But I still feel terrified inside. The police arrive after that after I have taken care of everything, and they too are impressed with what I was able to do. Everybody is impressed, but I feel terrified. I wake up scared. When I realize I am in Mattapan, I think. Wow. what a strange coincidence. that I as I was indeciph. looking for a safe place, of all the places I might have ended up I happened to end up right by the place where my mom grew up. amazing.\n",

I go to Hartford to visit Nanny, and on the way back, I take an alternate route, I think maybe it's called Route 2, it's a little. traveled route, and I pass by a bar, a dive bar, and I decide to stop for a drink. I order a pina. colada, but just before they're about to make it they mention that the price is 15. 95, so I tell them to forget it. I'm not paying that much for one drink. So I ask for a V8 instead. Then I go into the bathroom, and on my way into the bathroom I see Dr. Nevid. He looks really surprised to see me, taken aback. He asks me, Redacted First. Name2. what are you doing here? I explain that I was visiting my grandmother in Hartford and I decided to stop for a drink on the way home, so I just stopped in here. Then, as he is walking through the door that goes back to where the bar is, it occurs to me to ask him, what are you doing here? As soon as I do, I realize I've made a mistake because he looks really embarrassed and uncomfortable. It occurs to me, then, that maybe he's having an affair and his being here has something to do with his seeing the woman he's having an affair with, and this bothers me because his wife just had a baby recently. It also occurs to me that maybe he came here to see a prostitute, because this bar is that kind of place, a real dive. Then, later on, it occurs to me that maybe he came here for an interview, maybe he's planning to leave St. John's and work in Bridgeport instead I think this is in or near Bridgeport, and he does not want anyone to know yet. Those are the only reasons I can think if that he would have looked so taken aback and uncomfortable and embarrassed when I asked him what he was doing here. I also wonder why he did not just lie, make up some excuse for why he was here, but I guess that did not occur to him. I feel embarrassed about having asked a question that embarrassed him. Before that, I was driving on this road before I stopped, and a cop pulled me over. He asked me some questions about what I was doing here, somehow I get in the fact that I'm a doctoral student, he thinks this means biology student and asks a few questions related to biology as if to test whether I was being honest, I do all right, he was going to give me a ticket for speeding but now he softens and decides to let me go, I have to remember that this is Connecticut and I need to go slowly because they catch a lot of people speeding here.\n",

      "1. I am with someone in New York, and I am looking for a place to live. I want to buy a house or apartment. I start out looking in Putnam or Putnam County, which is some kind of rural area, rural or small. town type of area, one. and. a. half hours from New York City. At first I like the rural aspect compared with what it's like in the city, i. e. the open space, quiet, peacefulness, fresh air, etc. , but then I start to think, or maybe someone else points out to me, something about how there is not much to do here in a ruralsmall. town type of place like this, and if I want to see a film or go to the theater or have any other kind of culturally. oriented thing to do, I'd have to drive one. and. a. half hours each way. When I really think about that, it seems less appealing, and I decide to try to look for a place in the city. As I am getting into a car with one or two other people to go look in New York City, I say, Land in the city costs more than land in the country. its the law of supply and demand, and as I say this, I recall how this concept is part of the WISC. R intelligence test. Just before I said this, the person I'm with remarked that the closer you are to the city, the more expensive the property is going to be, Putnam County is going to be by far the cheapest. As we go into the city, I have or 'had' decided that I do wantneed to live in the city, but the person with me is warning me about how much places cost in the city and I tell her that unlike many other people, I am willing to live anywhere in the city, and that perhaps apartments in places like Harlem would be considerably cheaper than other places, and therefore I could get a good deal on a piece of property. The woman I am with looks surprised, she says something like, You'd really be willing to live in Harlem? I say Yes. I've worked all over the city. Flatbush, Harlem. and I lived in war zones for three years, all over the world. I'd be willing to live in Harlem or anywhere else in the city. I'm not intimidated by things like that.

He looks like Cornel West, reminds me of Cornel West. in his voice, especially. He is talking in a way designed to inspire, i. e. talking with passion, the people gathered here are people who fought in the Southern civil rights movement, and now this leader has brought them back to walk around the city, important places where things happened that they were involved in or participated in, and the idea is to get them back in touch with that passion, that era, and with the reasons they did what they did, so that they can teach this to the children students? pupils? with passion and conviction.

      "Something about Jane Karol. Something about Dotty Curhan . and some type of cancer. Something about dandelions, picking dandelions. And a Bedouin boy . something about a Bedouin boy. The Bedouin boy is selling colored shells, this is taking place in an area that looks like . is . the backyard area of Dotty Curhan. I am there, and I am with some kind of tour group, the tour group has been going around looking at different sights, like, at a movie screen in one place, something else at another place, like the tour bus has stopped at various places, and then come here . Earlier, when it stopped at each place, the tour. guide wanted some money from the people on the tour, like each person was supposed to pay not for the whole trip but at each site, at each site where they actually looked at whatever they were given an opportunity to look at; so that, like, if you stayed in one place and did not look at what the tour guide was showing you or listen to what he was telling you, you did not have to pay for that part. Anyway . we got to this area of the backyard of Dotty Curhan's house. And I called Jane Karol and we were supposed to have plans together, meet later on. And she says something about Can I leave to go there by around 100 instead of 130, because I'd been thinking of leaving here around 100. And I'd wanted to stay until like 130, but she wants met to leave at like 100. Something about Scott Buffington, or some other person, that Jane is in love with . Jane is in love with someone. Anyway . I had not been planning to pay much attention to this part of the tour, it seemed like nothing new, and then this Bedouin boy comes along with these colored shells, and he is like selling them, and the tour guide comes along and wants to buy some, in order to then be able to turn around and sell them to the people in the tour group at a profit, the tour guide speaks Arabic so he bargains some with the Bedouin boy, in Arabic, I get the feeling they are from the same culture, the Bedouin boy is willing to bargain but the price the guide is offering is really low it's not really a fair price, it's like he thinks he will be able to offer a very low price for colored shells, but as I see this, I visualize how far the child must have come, how he must have gone through the woods and over across the desert into the ocean area, the seashore, in order to collect these shells, just to be able to collect these colored shells. Also, as he had to wander far to gather them, I believe he deserves a fair price, a reasonable price. Meanwhile, my interest in this interaction has made me not want to leave as quickly or as soon to meet Jane. Also, as I lay here on the grass I think there are dandelions in the grass, someone comes along and dances, something about dancing . is it the Bedouin boy? The child has a sweet face, large eyes reminds me a little of the little boy Ludovic in the film last week but he does not look entirely like the boy from the film . he also has his own unique face, which I have never seen before, and he has a sweet nature, a sweet and likable and lovable nature.

But then, as the three of us begin to drive, we keep going forward and we cannot find any way to exit in order to go back and pick up Marty, it's like, there's no exit from the highway that will take us back to the place where we left him, the road keeps going forward, further and further on, and it seems we are getting further and further away from Marty and that it will be harder and harder to get back to the spot where we left him. And I'm afraid we will lose him, and I'm afraid of what he must be thinking, he must be feeling impatient, thinking we've left him behind, that we're never coming back to fetch him, that we've abandoned him, he must be worried and angry and upset, I feel so frustrated because we just cannot figure out how to get off this road and go back to where he is, the person driving the car it's not I is going to try to just back up the whole way since there's no place to get off the road and turn around but whenever she tries to go backwards, there are other cars coming up behind us and so there's no viable way to really travel backwards for very long along this busy road, and whenever there's an exit, it does not look like the kind that weave back around to where you were so you can reverse direction but only the kind that take you even further along in the direction you were going, and I feel more and more anxious about leaving Marty behind, more and more terrified that we'll never get back to him, and also worried about what he may be thinking and feeling. Finally, somehow, we do find a way to wind around and reconnect with the place where we left him, as we are approaching I say to the others, please, hurry . he has a heart condition . and our long absence may be making him extremely anxious . I know Marty does not really have a heart condition, and I worry a little that the other two will realize I made this up if they ever see him running his five miles a day, how vigorous he is, but I say this in order to get the others to hurry and to take seriously the need to get back there quickly and not to keep him waiting. When we finally reach there, Marty looks like he is basically all right; he was a little annoyed at how long we were gone but not completely devastated as we had feared. He says This time, I'm driving, and we do not argue, even though the person who'd been driving the car before had previously said that no one else was permitted to drive it. We are, all of us, relieved that we found each other again, against the odds, and can still be together. Yet when I wake up, in my body I still feel intense terror . pounding heart, sweaty body, shortness of breath . at not having been able to get back to him, at having moved so far beyond him, almost having left him behind. intense terror.\n",

      "I go to see Dr. Kantar. The office is in a place in Brookline that reminds me of the area where Dr. Berman's office was, that sort of building, etc. The building that his office is in also houses some sort of psychoanalytic institute or psychological training institute, and there are various people around here from that institute; as we are trying to meet, they kind of come and go, interrupting us, knocking on the door now and then, etc. At one point, when we first start meeting, and the door is open, Aunty Cynthia walks by. She sees me there but does not realize that this is Dr. Kantar's office and I'm talking with Dr. Kantar, so she just behaves casual and friendly, as if we ran into each other by chance in any ordinary place, but I feel uncomfortable and uptight because I do not really want her to know I'm speaking with Dr. Kantar, and I do not want her to tell my mother, I do not want my mother to find out my mother will find out. But later, I think that maybe this was not an accidentcoincidence, because, after all, it's so against the odds that we'd run into each other like that, here . maybe this was meant to happen because there's some reason that my mother needs to know I've been to see Dr. Kantar I'm afraid she'd be worried by this, the fact that I've chosen to go to see him is a positive, but she may be worried that I'll end up like my father. Anyway, Aunty Cynthia goes on, and we . Dr. Kantar and I . start to talk. I'm a little mad at myself for not preparing ahead of time . I did not set aside the time with Lila, to prepare, for example a list of questions I want to ask him or things I'd like to discuss with him. so now I have to try to just make it up as we go along, and I'm afraid I might miss something important, and I'm constantly afraid that he'll never let me come back . that this is it . my one and only chance to find out about my father and about my father's death happy father's day, dad, wherever you are! Thank you for sending me the swan poem. I start by telling Dr. Kantar something about how for 23 years I count the years to recall the number . I'd forgotten the exact number of years since he died! I never had a story . I had no coherent narrative about what happened, because my mother handled things insensitively and . to be truthful, irresponsibly . and so I never had the opportunity to create a coherent narrative . it was just like, Daddy died, and that's it, later I picked up bits and pieces, scraps of conversation, about accident, suicide, etc. , and I had to do my best to use those scraps to create some sort of patchwork story, but it was not a coherent narrative. So, it's taken me 23 years to weave together a coherent story, and so I feel a tremendous reluctance to take in information that would lead me to have to start all over again and create a whole new story journey, but at the same time, I want to learn as much as I can . I am kind of hoping that whatever I learn, I can use to refine and deepen the story I now have, rather than having to create a whole new story say you finally invented a new story. Blumenthal Anyway. I tell all this to Dr. Kantar, and, early on in our conversation, he is looking through some notes that he has, his notes from his last conversation with my father, i. e. the phone call from Maine. this note never appeared at the trial, and he says to me something about, Your father died because of his prostate problem . it was his prostate that killed him. At first I'm perplexed, so I ask him what he means. He looks at his notes, and says something about that on the night that he died, or the night before he died, he'd phoned Dr. Kantar and complained about . lamented, actually . his prostate problems, he was really in a lot of pain. and when Dr. Kantar had not been able to really help him with that, he'd called Dr. Siegel and told him of his prostate problems . lamented these . but Dr. Siegel could not help him with that either . of course, no one could have helped him with that except God! There's no way Dr. Kantar or Dr. Siegel could have helped him with his prostate prostrate problems . it is a spiritual problem, a spiritual problem of modern man. Anyway, as Dr. Kantar is telling me this, looking at his notes and telling me that my dad died because of his prostate problem, I blurt out interrupting him, Me too! That's exactly my problem too! That's just like me! Dr. Kantar asks me what I mean, or looks at me as if to ask what do I mean, and I tell him without wanting to tell him about the rape at this point, 'cause I do not want us to get sidetracked in that way, something like, Well, when I was given Benadryl a while back I do not mention the connection with Haldol, or being in the hospital . I do not want him to know that I was in a psychiatric hospital, at least not at this point . but I just say something like, When I took benadryl, it gave me bladder retention as I say this, I wonder if bladder retention is really the correct term for what I had, and I had to be catheterized several times over the course of three days, and it was very difficult for me . but even as I say this, I'm aware that the story that I'm telling does not completely justify the way I started by blurting out, Me too! I'm just like him! Anyway . we continue talking, he seems a little bit nebish, basically a nice guy but not extremely skillful and attuned like Lila, he runs his practice in such a way that people are in and out interrupting him. So, we are trying to talk, and I'm constantly afraid that we're going to run out of time, I will not get to have asked him all the things I want to ask him, I'll never get the chance to come back, I'm very nervous about that. I never finished reading the last part of his deposition, so I'm not as well. prepared in advance as I would have liked. So, we are talking, and he tells me about the prostate problem and the impact that it had on him it killed him . he died because of it and I am thinking, Oh, I'm going to have to revise my narrative once again maybe that's the sense in which we traded places, maybe that's the way he saved my life if you learn from his example, you do not have to do what he did . you can learn from his story, like the story of Jesus, like a parable . learn from Jerry's story as if it were a parable about the soul, or about God and man, man's search for God, and God's search for man . if you understand Jerry's story as a parable, you will understand the sense in which his death gave you your life, his dying enables you to live . to be spiritually alive, alive in the spirit, in the quest for God that Kees understood so well, almost like he died so that you might live . but is it really necessary that he had to sacrifice himself for me, that he had to be sacrificed in order that I might live? That is what the trading places dream seemed to be saying . but only if you see it as a parable . understanding Jerry's story as a parable. Anyway . Dr. Kantar and I are talking, and he says a few things that make me think he is familiar, at least basically familiar, with object relations theory, like he understands the notion of the Jerry part of me or the Jerry in me, Kees everything you need is within you Rilke letters to a young poet Look within, look within. Like, it seems like he has some basic familiarity with psychoanalytic theory, and he may even be involved with an institute the building looks a little like the White Institute Also . Dr. Kantar tells me something about a scientist, a guy my dad worked with, that spoke to him on the day he died or knew something about knows something about what happened on the day he died the book . I want that book near Dr. Berman's office, we are in one of those buildings near Dr. Berman's office.\n",

      "1. I am somewhere near Brookline, New Hampshire, I'm with Irit, I think maybe or was, a short while ago. The zip. code I'm at is only one number away from the number at Camp Tevya, so I decide to take a drive by Camp Tevya. When we pull up to Camp Tevya, there are a few trucks there, and it looks like something strange is going on, almost like it's not a regular camp session. I see Aaron Gordon getting out of his vehicle, it seems like he just wanted to drive by here to see how things were going here  nostalgia or whatever. He looks much younger than I would have imagined him being after all these years, and he looks different from how I remember him looking, but I know that it is him, Aaron Gordon. I tell the person I'm with, 'he was the director here for 25 years. ' Around then, when somebody  maybe me  asks what's going on, one of the men working here mentions that they are tearing down the camp, demolishing it. I ask something about what they are going to build here instead, and the guy says something that sounds trivial compared to what Tevya was, like condominiums or miniature golf or something. I look over at Aaron and he looks crushed. He gets back on his truck and is about to drive away. I think about what it must mean to him to have worked at a place for 25 years, committed your life to that place, given so much, and then to find out that they are tearing it all down, what that would feel like. I really feel for him, how painful this must be. I try to explain this to the person next to me in the car, but I'm not sure if she can understand it, since she never went there.\n",

I'm supposed to leave for the airport at 4 in the morning. I forgot to call a taxi ahead of time, so I need to call a taxi now. And I'm afraid that I will not be able to reach a taxi company that is open at this hour and that canwill come here quickly so I can still make the flight. The flight is scheduled to depart in about 30 minutes, so if it takes himher 15 minutes to get here that only leaves another 15. I'm not finished packing yet and am trying to hastily throw things into a suitcase. And I figure if I forget some things  e. g. , a bathing suit  I can just buy a new one in Hawaii. Then suddenly I'm in the house in Wayland, instead of in the one in Maryland, though the rest of the situation is the same. My mother happens to arrive home and I ask her if she could drive us Alisa and me to the airport so we will not have to take a chance on waiting for the taxi. She's upset with me for not being ready on time and is tempted to say no but does, in the end, agree, albeit reluctantly. Alisa is around, witnessing all this, because she is going to Hawaii with me.\n",

I want to tell people here that my father was in the circus fire, that he narrowly escaped death in the circus fire. Then I am with some people going on some sort of tour of Hartford, and I ask a police officer or something something about whether there is a memorial for the circus fire victims at Barbour St. He says no, that area is closed off now. I think he says that because it's in a rough neighborhood, not because it's really closed off, and he does not want us . those of us on tour . to see this part of Hartford.

Im figuring out as I go along . developed an allergy to grapes, because not long after I eat them I have a sensation of choking, as if Ive been poisoned or am having a severe reaction to something, a systemic reaction, as might occur with a severe allergy . it feels almost as if a log has been stuffed down my throat and is blocking the air passage . a feeling of constriction, tightness, almost like one might imagine would occur with a snake. bite, systemic toxicity, that sort of systemic toxicity, as in a reaction to having been bitten by a snake or stung by a bee. So, as I feel this occurring, and this is like the second or third time its occurred in this period, I figured out that it must be some sort of allergic reaction, or adverse reaction, to the grapes that I ate.

What happens is, I get this feeling in my throat, feeling of constriction, I then feel afraid, initially Im by myself, but then somehow Im around other people, it looks almost like some sort of college campus type place, the people here are mostly younger than I, or maybe Im younger in the dream, I dont know, but theres a kind of feeling that I dont belong here.

      "Im in a car, driving with Ray Hes driving the car, Im either in the back seat or the front passenger seat, or its possible that I start out in the back seat and then at some point I switch to the front passenger seat, I think thats what happens. At first there is a lot of silence because neither one of us knows what to talk about and we are afraid to touch the subject of the program, department, and my experience at St. Johns, etc. , because theres a positive feeling between us and we dont want to spoil it by bringing up all that old, painful stuff. Then, tentatively at first, and tactfully, I bring up the subject of my experience at St. Johns. I say something like, when I first started there, all I wanted was for the experience to be compact, thats all I could think about . let it be compact, let me finish as quickly as I can, within 2. 3 years or so, because I felt so burnt out from everything that had happened at Maryland, but then, once I got there, and Id been there for a few years, I relaxed more, I focused less on the time or need to finish quickly, need for compactness, and instead tried to get what I could from the experience, because I realized that the years go by so quickly in any case, and its true . the years have gone by fast, can you believe it . its already been nearly 7 years since I was kicked out of the program. No!, Ray says, not 7 years . thats impossible!, but even as he says it, a part of him is figuring out that its really true. Yes, I say, I got kicked out in 92, and I moved to New York in 93, so its been nearly 7 years since I was kicked out, and nearly 6 years since I moved to New York. Wow, Ray says, he is also taking in the reality of how much time has gone by, and I sense, intuitively, that because he is older than I, this fact of the passage of years, of how quickly the years fly by, means even more to him than it does to me, its as if the fact of the years having gone by so quickly moves him in some way. And I feel the same. I am not who I was, though some principle of being abides. Now that I have tactfully, sensitively opened up the topic of my having been at Maryland and moved to St. Johns, we both feel more comfortable and at ease, and we begin to talk more freely and honestly, and there is a sense of a genuine connection between us, mutual understanding, and even caring. I tell him a little about my time at St. Johns, I say something like I was into this, this, and this, like I mention some of the things Ive been involved in during my time in New York. And what about politics?, he says, smiling, good. naturedly, yet knowingly, as if hes alluding to departmental politics and how I had naively gotten caught up in politics when I was in the program in Maryland, and how thered been a certain adolescent quality to my stance and how Id needed to ripen and mature. I smile and reply No, Im not involved in politics anymore, or something like that, and in my facial expression and tone, its clear that I am expressing something about what I learned from the whole ordeal at Maryland, i. e. something like that I learned to stay away from that domain, and while we both realize there is a certain wisdom in this, there is also a tinge of sadness, in having had to let that part of myself go for now, in letting go of the dream of creating an ideal society and instead facing the reality, in moving beyond adolescent dreams and instead having the knowledge, depth and maturity of an adult. Then I say something to Ray about, That was quite an honor that Carol Bartels got the university. wide award for her essay on moral development . I mean, it would be somewhat impressive if it had been program. wide or even department. wide, but the fact that she got this award from among all the departments in the entire university . thats really an accomplishment. Ray appreciates my ability to speak about these things, to broach these subjects. Earlier in the dream, I had learned that Carol had gotten this award, I may have even been present in the auditorium when it was announced. I feel a lot of compassion and empathy for Ray, he seems very human to me, and decent . a decent man. Ray is driving to his home in Laurel, it is a little like in the days when we used to have the annual starting. a. new. year party there, only instead of a big party its something more intimate, I think its only people from my class, some or a few of the people from my class. I wake up while we are still in the car, I think, approaching the house. Ray is incredibly vivid and real. And so is the feeling of connection between us, it is almost like tenderness. Its like, we have both grown older and wiser and recognize our own vulnerabilities and mistakes, I realize the mistakes I made in how I handled things in the program, and he realizes the mistakes he made in how he handled things in the program. So, there is a kind of mutual understanding and sense of having grown wiser. In this whole experience of being in the car with him, there is a feeling that something has been healed, I wake up feeling a sense of wonder and awe, feeling moved, at the healing process, and at how it has taken its own organic course for the time that was necessary . 7 years. Earlier, just before this, I think theres a scene where Ray and I and some others from the program are in a large auditorium. type place on the University of Maryland campus.

Just before Joel and I go in to the reunion, I want to give him some materials to read and take in with him, they are related to the genealogical research Ive been doing, and I feel that reading them and having them with him will help him find out what I want him to find out. But he says something like, No, I dont need to see that, Ive already seen it I know that even if hes seen it he hasnt read it carefully, I think that what I want to give him to read has something to do with the history of Mark Redacted Surname Variation, and I want him to read it because I want him to connect with Mark at this reunion. I think that in this parking. lot scene, Joels kids . Jeffrey, Mike, and Scott . are also around. like they are in the car that we arrive in or something. When we get inside the reunion, I either see, or recall having seen, a newspaper article, either in a real newspaper or in a school. type newspaper, about how the woman who was the prom queen in 19 has now returned, bulging into her gown, or something like that, they are apparently alluding to the fact that she has gained so much weight in the past 50 years or so that now when she puts her gown on she is bulging into it a lot. I feel it was inconsiderate of them to write that in the newspaper, even though I also figure that thats part of the era theyre from and how they spoke about women. I am struck by the fact that she has kept her prom. queen gown for all these years nearly 50 years, and I wonder what that means to her. I wonder if somehow her having kept the gown relates to the fact that her brother committed suicide, it is somehow a link with the period of her life in which she knew him. Anyway, Im inside the reunion with Uncle Joel and the others. Then, at some point, someone ' it may be this woman, I think it is ' talks about how her brother committed suicide so many years ago. She says that hed been an alcoholic, and then hed quit drinking and gone sober for a while longer than he ever had before, like several weeks or several months, she says that during this period when he was sober, he was either arrested or hospitalized for a while, I cant remember which, but he was like laid up somewhere for some time, and then when he got out, he had gotten drunk again for the first time in several weeks or months and he decided to drive home and somehow something about the way he drove home, or in the course of driving home, he killed himself, and something hed said to his sister just before leaving the police station or hospital had made her realize that his death was by suicide. So, she is telling all about this at the reunion, and it is clear that she still misses him, thinks about him every day, and is still grieving his death.\n",

      "2. I go to a Weaver High School reunion, with Joel. Mark Redacted Surname Variation's presence is also around here. Just before Joel and I go in to the reunion, I want to give him some materials to read and take in with him, they are related to the genealogical research I've been doing, and I feel that reading them and having them with him will help him find out what I want him to find out. But he says something like, 'No, I do not need to see that, I've already seen it' I know that even if he's seen it he has not read it carefully, I think that what I want to give him to read has something to do with the history of Mark Redacted Surname Variation, and I want him to read it because I want him to connect with Mark at this reunion. I think that in this parking. lot scene, Joel's kids . Jeffrey, Mike, and Scott . are also around. like they are in the car that we arrive in or something. When we get inside the reunion, I either see, or recall having seen, a newspaper article, either in a real newspaper or in a school. type newspaper, about how 'the woman who was the prom queen in 19 has now returned, bulging into her gown', or something like that, they are apparently alluding to the fact that she has gained so much weight in the past 50 years or so that now when she puts her gown on she is bulging into it a lot. I feel it was inconsiderate of them to write that in the newspaper, even though I also figure that that's part of the era they're from and how they spoke about women. I am struck by the fact that she has kept her prom. queen gown for all these years nearly 50 years, and I wonder what that means to her. I wonder if somehow her having kept the gown relates to the fact that her brother committed suicide, it is somehow a link with the period of her life in which she knew him. Anyway, I'm inside the reunion with Uncle Joel and the others. Then, at some point, someone  it may be this woman, I think it is  talks about how her brother committed suicide so many years ago.

The person has been given the death penalty, or something like that, and most of the people in Japan want to show mercy on him. And the people may have some say in this. And this is like some part of a public event, where the authorities have dipped deep into this well, very very deep, and brought up this mummified man, and the thing is, people from the surrounding public who were here when he was first put into the earth 5. 6 years ago, have returned to now see him brought up to the surface again, and to look at him. As I hear about this and, I think, see this, it occurs to me that some young men in Japan here might come to see this and as they stare into this mans face, might wonder how on earth 5. 6 years went by already when it seems like just yesterday that they buried him, and might, as they stare into this mans face, see and understand something about their own fate and the fate of all men ' i. e. the passage of time, inevitable decay, decline, death mortality, kind of like in that movie Dead Poets Society when Robin Williams has the students look at the faces of the students from long ago while saying that these students from long ago are urging them Carpe Diem, Carpe Diem, because life goes by fast. So, it occurs to me that thats what these young men might see and feel as they look into the face of this man who was lowered into the earth 5. 6 years ago and is now being raised up again.

But now that hes being brought back up to the surface and has been given the death penalty, he is going to really be irrevocably killed and re. lowered into the deep well deep earth, rather than simply frozenossifiedmummified. And people from all over Japan are grieving over this, are sad about this the story of the hero is the story of grief because it represents a new level of evolution in their culture, that now, for the first time, they are going to exercise the death penalty, that now, for the first time, they are going to kill a man i. e. , lower him back into the deep welldeep earth, permanently, where he cant be brought up again. maybe something about calcium ' maybe related to the ossification? like, his bones need calcium or something?

I have a car, perhaps its a rental, I have a flight to catch to come back to the States, I think its a night. flight, the timing is tight, I drive to the airport, but I miss the exit that I need, the exit that leads to Ben Gurion, once I miss the exit, it looks like I will almost certainly miss my plane, it was like a 9 or 10 PM flight back to the States. Also, I cant find my way ' I dont know how to get there i. e. , to the airport from here. Somehow I end up at this dance school, without my car. I think what happened is, I caught a ride with someone, and she stopped at this dance school. caught a ride with someone and I thought she was taking me directly to the airport, but instead, she stops at this dance school makes a detour. When I get to the dance school, I explain that I need to get to the airport as soon as possible, but it is clear that by now I will have already missed my flight it is already 9 or 10 at night. So, the woman working there, who apparently directs the school, raises to me the question of why Im going to go to the airport tonight when Ive already missed my flight, like she is suggesting that I should wait until the morning. She has a casual attitude about the whole thing, she doesnt seem to realize that its a big deal that I missed my flight. I tell her, Well, I missed my flight, that means I have a lot of things to take care of, Ill have to make arrangements for tomorrow, get everything all straightened out, I need to make arrangements, get everything all straightened out for tomorrow, book a new flight, perhaps rent a car, etc. I add something about needing to make alternative arrangements for tomorrow since I missed my flight, but the truth is that I didnt really have any plans for tomorrow. I didnt really have any plans for tomorrow, but Im trying to emphasize that Ive missed my flight and its serious. The woman from the dance school doesnt seem to take it that seriously, she seems to be more casual or relaxed about it. So, she doesnt seem to be doing anything to help me get there tonight rather than tomorrow. tonight, rather than tomorrow tonight rather than tomorrow I wake up feeling very anxious. In another scene ' I dont know whether it was before or after this one ' Im standing on the road somewhere in or near perhaps just outside of Jerusalem, trying to hail a sherut or monit because Ive missed my flight or am trying to catch the flight and its a very tight connection, I think maybe one car slows and stops and I think its going to be mine and then another person ' a woman, I think ' jumps in, and this makes me feel more determined and even aggressive about making sure that the next one that stops is mine. A few minutes later a minute or two, another car slows and stops. There are two other parties who want to get in it and who in reality may have seen indeciph. it before I did ' I think ones a couple male. female and one is a man, I think hes a British man ' he has a British. type accent. Dark hair, dark eyes, I think. Even though I realize that maybe he had the cab first and its not clear ' maybe he did, maybe he didnt, I make sure that I jump in, he is rather shocked and put off that I jumped in, I say to him In Israel ' you have to be pushy or This is Israel ' you have to be pushy, he looks at me with recognition, he doesnt necessarily like this aspect of Israelis, but he knows I am right, he knows this is true in Israel, the pushy one wins, the non. pushy ones lose out ' thats just how it is. I feel like even though hes annoyed or dismayed that he didnt get this cab, maybe hes learned something important in the process maybe Ive taught him something.\n",

We ordered a brownie sundae and I could actually smell and taste it. I went into another area of the restaurant and saw my best friend from home's dad, Junior. He is also my boyfriend's boss. We talked about basketball tournaments. As I was in live to pay, I saw a Native American man. I asked him what tribe he was, but he did not answer because he was drunk and falling over. Then Junior told me that he was from the reservation in Santa Cruz.

It was really dark and I do not remember seeing anyone else's faces, but it was crowded. Our two other friends were on the train, and they wanted to get off at the first stop because they realized that where we were going was not going to be fun. They jumped off the train as it slowed down. It was going really slow, but my roommate and I did not know if we should get off or not. We decided to get off and it was really hard because the train was moving. I had to climb down the edge really slowly and thought I was going to fall off. I remember breathing really hard and trying not to fall. Once we got off we saw the train speed up and drive away. I had another dream about trying on clothes. I was in a huge white house with a few friends and I was trying to get to my 1150 class. I had a long skirt on. I remember seeing these shoes that I had not had for about two years, and I could not fit my foot into, but finally did, and they made me a lot taller. I was not happy with my shirt and kept changing it. Running from upstairs, my mom's room, to downstairs with all of these mirrors. I liked this brown outfit. It was sort of flowing, but changed into a tighter white shirt that only had one button. I was very skinny, looked really good in the clothes. The whole time, I kept looking at the clock, trying to get to my 1150 class. Because I kind of knew I was dreaming at the end.\n",

I had to hide out and there was one family that repeatedly took me in to hide me and make sure I was okay. I remember that the assistant student director of my dorm was a cop that was repeatedly trying to find me. There were people who kept trying to kill me as well. My house was ransacked and most of my belongings were destroyed. My room was blown up as well. In the last part they finally got me to a prison, but this old lady, who thought I was a princess, showed me a hidden passage and I was able to get out and run to the family again  the family that had been looking out for me.

It appeared to read wallin, I remember feeling astonished that I had lived in this complex for some time and new this was not the name of it, but could not remember the other name. Then the sign morphed into Z?. Upon my explanation that I could not read the sign the girl in front of me gave me a weird look. So I tried to explain myself. It was as though I was an adventure film and I was the camera something happened and this guy ran with his partner, you know she was Angelina Jolie but could not see her. I remember feeling the excitement of the chase  the fear while descending a later and the rush from the speeding away  only then she was not on the motorcycle  it was me I was running in front of Swig and I was feeling fatigued and frustrated at not being able to keep up with the motorcycle.\n",

      "Im in my bedroom in Wayland or somewhere that looks like Wayland. My mother and I are having a fight ' a big, major fight. We are shouting at each other very loudly and intensely, and also, to some extent, fighting physically. I am saying things like I hope you die! We are pushing, shoving, wrestling, shouting. What happened is 'I was on the phone trying to listen to the man tell me where my car is, and my mother had the TV turned on loud, and I asked her if she could please turn down the TV for just 2 minutes so I could hear what this man was saying on the phone, and she refused ' she wouldnt turn down the volume. And I only wanted her to do so for a minute or so, so I could hear! Thats how this fight started. The man on the phone ' he did me a special favor ' he arranged that my car would be towed to a bridge near the Cape, so that I could pick it up on my way back to New York or wherever, instead of having to completely go out of my way. What happened before that is'I was working for some sort of hospital that serves children ' reminds me of The Bridge, only I think the children are younger. And its also kind of like a day hospital for children, and I have a position there, like I did in college. And its nighttime, and for some reason I want to take the van and do something, its just going to be some sort of quick errand or something, in or near Manhattan I think, maybe. And Im not really supposed to take the van for non. work. related things, though we are allowed to take it and drive it if a need arises thats work. related, i. e. for the kids. I get in the van and start driving, and after a short while theres a narrow street, and I am going down it one way, and this other car is going down it the other way, but I assume and trust that we will each move a little to the side, i. e. , I to the right, he to the left, so that we can both pass and not i. e. , making room for each other ' or actually ' but when I move to the right a little as needed, he does not move at all, he just keeps barrelling forward, without regard for me, and so we have a collision, and somehow a third car is involved too, ends up crashing into us as well. The crash is a big one, with a big impact, scary, loud, intense, a big intense crash, with all three cars, though the worst of it is this one car that was facing me, and me ' the third one is slightly more peripheral. And the impact is loud and harsh. ' At first it seems like there may well have been a serious injury, but then I quickly assess that Im ok ' not seriously injured ' and I check to see that the other guy is ok ' and the 3rd guy, though the impact was harsh for him too, has already taken off. He literally took only a second or so, pulled his car out of the 3. car wreckpile, and drove away ' it gave me the impression that he had something to fear related to, for example, not being able to afford any potential liability or losses or payments, needing to speed away quickly to spare himself the risk of any involvement in this matter. So, hes gone ' but it wasnt his fault anyway. I want to take off too, because I dont want to get in trouble for using the van for this personal errand, and also, I dont want to be towed, I want to be able to drive away, and go where Im going, I dont want to have to be at the mercy of a tow. truck driver dependent on someone else to take me to where I need to go, at someone elses mercy. I want to avoid having to submit to a tow. truck driver at all costs! The van looks pretty intact, and I think that despite the harsh impact of the crash, I can probably just quickly get it together and drive away, before the police come I fear theyll arrive any minute, then theyll have to make an accident report, and Ill never get away. But I cant manage to drive away, because even though the car looks fairly intact and I am basically ok to drive, though scared and shaken, the steering wheel has broken off. It has literally broken off ' so that theres only the stick sticking up, i. e. the stick that the steering wheel would be placed at the end of, to move the car with and to steer with ' its completely broken off, and theres no way this stick ' so even if I could get it together enough to get the car started and get the car to run, theres no way for me to steer the car, nothing to steer with, and since its completely broken off, its not something I can control ' much as I want to control this and seize the moment and drive away, I absolutely cannot control this absence of a steering wheel ' theres no way I can drive the car without it. So I am trying to figure out what to do, becoming anxious that I cant just drive away, and worried about all the consequences and hassles that will ensue when the police arrive, somewhere in this, when it first happened, I also did initially call to the other driver are you ok?, to make sure he was ok, and he was. He has no choice but to wait for the police to come because his car is a wreck ' he cant go anywhere. Next scene ' Im in a restaurant with a bunch of people ' new friends I have made or new people I have come to know ' reminds me a little of a Weirlab type of thing, I think. And I have been here for a time, and now, because of this crash, it is time for me to leave and go back and deal with all this, so I have to leave a little earlier than the others, so Im the one whos going around and saying goodbye to each person, and getting special hugs and special attention and so forth ' individualized, toward me. Although there are both men and women in this group reminds me a little of my LGI group, with people like red. haired Danny and all, Gingy, its mostly the men who are giving me attention, the men here are very much into me, have strong feelings for me, some idealization of me, lots of attention, they give me lots of attention. So, as Im going around this table a large rectangular table, with lots of people, plus there are several smaller tables, this is some sort of big event, like a goodbye party or a last. night. of. the. trip party or something, the men are all giving me big hugs and a lot of attention and warmth reminds me a little of the jurors in my case, and how they were with me. The women see this and have somewhat mixed feelings about it ' on the one hand, they too have basically warm feelings and affection for me, on the other hand, they feel a little jealous of all this male attention Im receiving and of the intensity of the mens feelings for me. But for the most part, the women too are giving me warm goodbyes. What happens is, Im basically going around to each person at the table and giving them a hug, and although the quality of the hug varies somewhat person by person, for the most part these are close, warm, intense embraces. There is one woman ' she reminds me very, very much of that woman I faced in the Weirlab the one with the short curly hair, short woman during that exercise ' I think it may even be her ' and when I get to her, we French kiss ' it is like a somewhat sexual kiss ' right on the line between a regular, friendship. type kiss. on. the. lips, and a clearly, unquestionably sexual kiss. on. the. lips ' right on that line ' but it does feel sexual to me, feels like more than just a regular kiss between friends ' and actually, this was a question in my kisses with the men too, and with most of the people Im going around saying goodbye to here ' we would kiss on the lips, our mouths would be partly open and partly not open, and it was really ambiguous at times whether it was a friendship kiss or a sexual kiss, and also, there was a question, for most of these contacts, of how much to open my mouth to theirs and how much to close my mouth to theirs ' that interplay between opening and closing ' and it makes me feel a bit awkward, because Im not certain how much to open my mouth and how much to close or seal or pucker it ' with most of the men, I think the kisses were fairly open. mouthed, and with this woman, we are basically French. kissing. And at one point, while this is happening, I also recall that I dreamed that I was kissing this woman ' so I have a deja. vu type experience in kissing her while recalling having had a dream that I kissed her, or an experience like, Wow ' I dreamed this, and now its really happening ' the people here all know about the accident, and know that I have to leave early because of it, thats why theyre all saying goodbye to me as I go around the table to each person. And they all are hoping for me that things work out and that I take care of what needs to be taken care of ' i. e. , they are wishing me the best, though some of the women are a little jealous of the extent of the male attention Ive received. last part of this scene ' me and that woman, French. kissing, it feels good and right to be kissing her in this way, and I have that deja. vu. When I step outside, something related to the tow. truck occurs ' I dont see this visually ' but somehow I sense that a tow. truck driver has now come and taken my car somewhere, and Im worried about where, and hoping that hes not taking it too far out of my way, too far away from where I need to go. I get the sense that the two. truck driver is a nice man, and is going to try to do his best for me. The next scene ' is the scene in Wayland with my mother ' she and I are both in my bedroom ' theres already an atmosphere of tension just from our being here, the TV is on, then the phone rings and the tow. truck driver is trying to tell me when I can pick up the van, and it seems he went to an extra effort to deliver the car to a place near this bridge to the Cape, so it would be easier and more convenient for me to pick it up and go where I need to go, but I cant hear what hes saying because the TV is so loud, and my mother wont turn down the volume ' whats going on in this house and in this room feels so loud and intrusive, so pushy, so overwhelming, so overpowering and violating, intrusive, I feel like theres no space for me, no space for me to be, no space for me to grow, no space for me to play or relax, no place for me to be with, no space for me to let go, no space for me to be, no space for me to be with, no space for me to relax ' I feel anxious and tense ' this whole scene feels so fraught with tension ' the tension is so high ' the anxiety is so high ' I feel like I have to put all my energy into protecting myself and defending myself from being violated and overwhelmed, and theres no energy left over for me to enjoy myself or play or relax or be in the interaction, with spontaneity and freedom and lightness is that what joy is?, its just so fraught with tension and anxiety, I wake up as my mother and I are screaming and fighting and shouting and wrestling, its not a good feeling inside, I feel anxious and angry and desperate and scared.\n",

      "I'm in my bedroom in Wayland or somewhere that looks like Wayland. My mother and I are having a fight  a big, major fight. We are shouting at each other very loudly and intensely, and also, to some extent, fighting physically. I am saying things like 'I hope you die!' We are pushing, shoving, wrestling, shouting. What happened is  I was on the phone trying to listen to the man tell me where my car is, and my mother had the TV turned on loud, and I asked her if she could please turn down the TV for just 2 minutes so I could hear what this man was saying on the phone, and she refused  she would not turn down the volume. And I only wanted her to do so for a minute or so, so I could hear! That's how this fight started. The man on the phone  he did me a special favor  he arranged that my car would be towed to a bridge near the Cape, so that I could pick it up on my way back to New York or wherever, instead of having to completely go out of my way. What happened before that is I was working for some sort of hospital that serves children  reminds me of The Bridge, only I think the children are younger. And it's also kind of like a day hospital for children, and I have a position there, like I did in college. And it's nighttime, and for some reason I want to take the van and do something, it's just going to be some sort of quick errand or something, in or near Manhattan I think, maybe. And I'm not really supposed to take the van for non. work. related things, though we are allowed to take it and drive it if a need arises that's work. related, i. e. for the kids. I get in the van and start driving, and after a short while there's a narrow street, and I am going down it one way, and this other car is going down it the other way, but I assume and trust that we will each move a little to the side, i. e. , I to the right, he to the left, so that we can both pass and not i. e. , making room for each other  or actually  but when I move to the right a little as needed, he does not move at all, he just keeps barrelling forward, without regard for me, and so we have a collision, and somehow a third car is involved too, ends up crashing into us as well. The crash is a big one, with a big impact, scary, loud, intense, a big intense crash, with all three cars, though the worst of it is this one car that was facing me, and me  the third one is slightly more peripheral. And the impact is loud and harsh.  At first it seems like there may well have been a serious injury, but then I quickly assess that I'm ok  not seriously injured  and I check to see that the other guy is ok  and the 3rd guy, though the impact was harsh for him too, has already taken off. He literally took only a second or so, pulled his car out of the 3. car wreckpile, and drove away  it gave me the impression that he had something to fear related to, for example, not being able to afford any potential liability or losses or payments, needing to speed away quickly to spare himself the risk of any involvement in this matter. So, he's gone  but it was not his fault anyway. I want to take off too, because I do not want to get in trouble for using the van for this personal errand, and also, I do not want to be towed, I want to be able to drive away, and go where I'm going, I do not want to have to be at the mercy of a tow. truck driver dependent on someone else to take me to where I need to go, at someone else's mercy. I want to avoid having to submit to a tow. truck driver at all costs! The van looks pretty intact, and I think that despite the harsh impact of the crash, I can probably just quickly get it together and drive away, before the police come I fear they'll arrive any minute, then they'll have to make an accident report, and I'll never get away. But I cannot manage to drive away, because even though the car looks fairly intact and I am basically ok to drive, though scared and shaken, the steering wheel has broken off. It has literally broken off  so that there's only the stick sticking up, i. e. the stick that the steering wheel would be placed at the end of, to move the car with and to steer with  it's completely broken off, and there's no way this stick  so even if I could get it together enough to get the car started and get the car to run, there's no way for me to steer the car, nothing to steer with, and since it's completely broken off, it's not something I can control  much as I want to control this and seize the moment and drive away, I absolutely cannot control this absence of a steering wheel  there's no way I can drive the car without it. So I am trying to figure out what to do, becoming anxious that I cannot just drive away, and worried about all the consequences and hassles that will ensue when the police arrive, somewhere in this, when it first happened, I also did initially call to the other driver 'are you ok?', to make sure he was ok, and he was. He has no choice but to wait for the police to come because his car is a wreck  he cannot go anywhere. Next scene  I'm in a restaurant with a bunch of people  new friends I have made or new people I have come to know  reminds me a little of a Weirlab type of thing, I think. And I have been here for a time, and now, because of this crash, it is time for me to leave and go back and deal with all this, so I have to leave a little earlier than the others, so I'm the one who's going around and saying goodbye to each person, and getting special hugs and special attention and so forth  individualized, toward me. Although there are both men and women in this group reminds me a little of my LGI group, with people like red. haired Danny and all, 'Gingy', it's mostly the men who are giving me attention, the men here are very much into me, have strong feelings for me, some idealization of me, lots of attention, they give me lots of attention. So, as I'm going around this table a large rectangular table, with lots of people, plus there are several smaller tables, this is some sort of big event, like a goodbye party or a last. night. of. the. trip party or something, the men are all giving me big hugs and a lot of attention and warmth reminds me a little of the jurors in my case, and how they were with me. The women see this and have somewhat mixed feelings about it  on the one hand, they too have basically warm feelings and affection for me, on the other hand, they feel a little jealous of all this male attention I'm receiving and of the intensity of the men's feelings for me. But for the most part, the women too are giving me warm goodbyes. What happens is, I'm basically going around to each person at the table and giving them a hug, and although the quality of the hug varies somewhat person by person, for the most part these are close, warm, intense embraces. There is one woman  she reminds me very, very much of that woman I faced in the Weirlab the one with the short curly hair, short woman during that exercise  I think it may even be her  and when I get to her, we French kiss  it is like a somewhat sexual kiss  right on the line between a regular, friendship. type kiss. on. the. lips, and a clearly, unquestionably sexual kiss. on. the. lips  right on that line  but it does feel sexual to me, feels like more than just a regular kiss between friends  and actually, this was a question in my kisses with the men too, and with most of the people I'm going around saying goodbye to here  we would kiss on the lips, our mouths would be partly open and partly not open, and it was really ambiguous at times whether it was a friendship kiss or a sexual kiss, and also, there was a question, for most of these contacts, of how much to open my mouth to theirs and how much to close my mouth to theirs  that interplay between opening and closing  and it makes me feel a bit awkward, because I'm not certain how much to open my mouth and how much to close or seal or pucker it  with most of the men, I think the kisses were fairly open. mouthed, and with this woman, we are basically French. kissing. And at one point, while this is happening, I also recall that I dreamed that I was kissing this woman  so I have a deja. vu type experience in kissing her while recalling having had a dream that I kissed her, or an experience like, 'Wow  I dreamed this, and now it's really happening'  the people here all know about the accident, and know that I have to leave early because of it, that's why they're all saying goodbye to me as I go around the table to each person. And they all are hoping for me that things work out and that I take care of what needs to be taken care of  i. e. , they are wishing me the best, though some of the women are a little jealous of the extent of the male attention I've received. last part of this scene  me and that woman, French. kissing, it feels good and right to be kissing her in this way, and I have that deja. vu. When I step outside, something related to the tow. truck occurs  I do not see this visually  but somehow I sense that a tow. truck driver has now come and taken my car somewhere, and I'm worried about where, and hoping that he's not taking it too far out of my way, too far away from where I need to go. I get the sense that the two. truck driver is a nice man, and is going to try to do his best for me. The next scene  is the scene in Wayland with my mother  she and I are both in my bedroom  there's already an atmosphere of tension just from our being here, the TV is on, then the phone rings and the tow. truck driver is trying to tell me when I can pick up the van, and it seems he went to an extra effort to deliver the car to a place near this bridge to the Cape, so it would be easier and more convenient for me to pick it up and go where I need to go, but I cannot hear what he's saying because the TV is so loud, and my mother will not turn down the volume  what's going on in this house and in this room feels so loud and intrusive, so pushy, so overwhelming, so overpowering and violating, intrusive, I feel like there's no space for me, no space for me to be, no space for me to grow, no space for me to play or relax, no place for me to be with, no space for me to let go, no space for me to be, no space for me to be with, no space for me to relax  I feel anxious and tense  this whole scene feels so fraught with tension  the tension is so high  the anxiety is so high  I feel like I have to put all my energy into protecting myself and defending myself from being violated and overwhelmed, and there's no energy left over for me to enjoy myself or play or relax or be in the interaction, with spontaneity and freedom and lightness is that what joy is?, it's just so fraught with tension and anxiety, I wake up as my mother and I are screaming and fighting and shouting and wrestling, it's not a good feeling inside, I feel anxious and angry and desperate and scared.\n",

      "063 I am with a group of men who are submariners. We are on land in the country. They have been detected and seek to escape. They seem to be a mix of Americans and Russians. I climb on top of the submarine, which is also on dry land; the Captain, a Russian, stands beneath me, I steer the ship like a car down a long dirt road. We are spotted by Russian agents disguised as civilians. Soon we are being chased by men who seek to arrest us. I drive faster and faster and seem to have lost them. Then we must get out of the submarine because I have driven into a cul. de. sac. It is now every man for himself; I try hiding in the cellar of a barn, but am not quick enough, and am caught, as is the Captain. Then I escape, I run and find a woman sitting outside her house and ask her for help; she does not help me. I keep running, I seem to have obtained freedom, but then I am at the edge of the sea. There are great sand dunes that reach into the clear water. I am being pursued again and have no choice I swim into the ocean, The water is warm and clear, the waves are big but not violent. It is very light and sunny, I attempt to escape by swimming under water. However, at close range three Russian agents triangulate my position. Looking beneath me, I see a large dark American submarine that has come to my rescue and begins to rise from below. However, it is too late. The agents begin shooting with pistols and high powered rifles and I am shot.\n",

      "Ok last night I had a wild dream. There were all these different parts I will just mention what I remember, it does not flow too well because I am forgetting some things. Ok first I remember I was going to some costume party and I wanted to be the devil. But I could not find a devil mask. I looked all over my house and still could not find one. Finally my friend gave me a red cowboy hat I could wear, not quite the same as a devil mask but in the dream it seemed to satisfy me. Then I remember getting some tattoos on my lower arms and my hands one place I probably would not get tattoos, at least not my hands. I do not remember what the tattoos were, other than some weird design and some words. Then, I suddenly realized I had tattoos on my hand that were now there for life, and was a little unhappy about that. That's all I remember about that piece of the dream. Next, I remember being in control of this car. I was not actually in the car, I was above the car, up in the air, yet controlling it, either with a remote or my mind, I do not remember. Yet at the same time I must have been IN the car because I was worried about getting pulled over by the cops. Anyway since I had control of this car I made it drive down these residential streets at like 90 miles per hours, hitting a few things along the way, it was cool heh. Then I remember coming to this place, and there was this guy and his dog standing there, but they did not see me, although I thought they did. I got concerned because I thought they were going to start following me. I started walking along this path and came to this little structure with all these statues. I sat on one of the statues and watched the people. The statues were of Female Basketball players. LOL The next part of the dream, I am driving in a car with some other people, we were on a mission to do something, but I cannot remember what. We get to the post office and pull into the parking lot, which was flooded and empty. As soon as we pull in another car, which looked like it was full of hispanic people, pulled up. The girl in the back seat pulled out a gun and pointed it at us. Then I remember getting out of the car and being forced to the ground, in a bush no less. The gun was pointed making contact with the top of my head. I was scared shitless and shaking, can actually remember feeling it as if it were happening. Then suddenly a thought goes through my mind asking why I was scared. If I were shot I would die instantly and feel NO pain. I personally am not scared of DEATH, it's just the WAY in which I die that has me a little concerned. So I realized I had nothing to be afraid of, if it was my time, it was my time and I would go out painlessly. Then she moved the gun from the top of my head around to the back at the base of my head and neck. We were taken to this house. I knew, for some reason, that they were going to kill us, or at least the people I was with. I remember the people, who lived at that house, talking to me like nothing was wrong. They took one of the people I was with who turned out to be someone that works with me in real life. At first it appeared as if they were going to cut his throat, but as weird as dreams are, they ended up giving him a tattoo right on his neck. 2 little symbols near his adams apple, OUCH. Then this black guy came up to me and asked me if I was bi. sexual. I do not remember what I said, and then he told me he was bi. sexual and walked away switching his ass like a girl would. Then I woke up. Talk about STRANGE!\n",

      "I had one hell of a dream last night. Actually it was really 3, and the last 2, even though I woke up inbetween them, kept the exact same story line going. The first dream was short and sweeeeeeeeeeeeeet. haha I was making out with Aaron of Staind. Not sure why but I was. Anyway that's all I remember of that one grin. Then I woke up and fell back asleep. I was having this dream where I was on this adventure. Basically there is this computer adventure game that a bunch of us were playing as a competition. Whoever finishes first wins some prize, I had won last year too. The wierd part, it is a dream after all, is the game itself did not take place as a computer game, I was the character so to speak. So it was a REAL adventure game in some parts. I remember towards the end of the game I had to break into this store room of a drug store. I broke in and I remember when opening the door it was about 5 feet down. I got in and went over to this closet and grabbed some object that secured my victory. Then I was trying to leave and I was having an extremely hard time getting back out the door since it was 5 feet up and I am only 5'2. I was pulling myself out but I could not get my leg up. I was worried the cops were going to come but I did not hear sirens or anything. I did however hear an alarm. I finally got my leg up and got out. Next, I remember I was supposed to meet my friend Chyrise at 8AM at my house. And I was not going to make it. I kept trying to call her on my cell phone but everytime my friend told me the number I could not remember what number he has said and kept fucking up the dial. dreams. So finally I handed him the phone and he dialed. I got a hold of her I think, do not remember. That's all I really remember of that section. When I fell back asleep I remember that I so far had the fastest game completion time and was in the lead. Then I remember I was hanging out with some guy that I am assuming was my boyfriend or guy I was dating. We were at his house I guess but kepted getting bothered by all these people and could not be alone, it had something to do with his job. I was getting pissed off. We were watching some movie and did not get to finish it because of this. I think we made out a few times too grin. Finally I left and went home, which was this house where I lived with a bunch of other people. He then came by later and we made up making up is fun. More kissing. Then I remember some girl and I were hanging out and she was at our house and sitting there fussing about burning her hand. I went into my room and was going to watch that video. She came in and sat down and then said to me Irish people think it's wrong if you play the TV in front of them while they are injured, and you did not even ask me what was wrong with my hand. I was like What the FUCK, I'm part irish and never heard of that shit before. Basically pissed her off enough for her to leave. Then some OTHER guy was there, do not know who he was but he was cute, and we ended up making out on the bed, DAMN I MUST REALLY NEED SOME SEX OR SOMETHING. All we did was kiss but he was a gooood kisser. Amazing how after the dream you can actually remember exactly what it felt like.  Then there was some problem because his girlfriend stopped by so we had to stop for a while. HAHA. But that was ok another guy took his place later HAVE MERCY. Speaking of this other guy, it was some guy, again I do not know who, black man actually. Although I dated a lot of black guys in highschool so there was nothing abnormal about that. We were making out in another room for a while and then he had to go play THE GAME. See the game from the previous dream found it's way back in the dream. I was still in the lead. He left with 3 other guys, they were all dressed up in some kind of costume. Then I remember walking down the beach talking to another guy who was just about to start playing the game and he had some questions that I was trying to help answer. That's all I remember. But hey I kissed 3 really cute guys that in itself makes a great dream. HAHAHA \n",

      "Ok last night I remembered 2 dreams. Basically had one and then woke up, went back to sleep and it continued. In the first part I remember my pastor i used to be christian and went to a specific church it did not end too well and i still hold some animosity towards my pastor so tend to dream about him from time to time was in my dream. At one point I remember we were all sitting at a table talking and he was commenting on his hair, how he had darkened part of it. The top part was still gray but he had darkened the bottom part black. Not sure what the significance was in him telling us this. Then I remember another part where I was walking with a friend and we walked by this guy who used to go to my church and I said out loud we missed hearing Tommy sing as if he were in the choir. I looked over at him as I said this and he was looking at me nodding his head, as if to say yes you did. Then in the 2nd part of the dream I remember being with this one person, people from my church seemed to still be involved. I was hanging out with him and remember him being really sad or depressed about something. This was a guy that went to my church as well in my dream not in real life, i have no idea who he was, but he was cute. Anyway I remember in the dream that I knew I was having doubts about my faith and really wanted to talk to someone about it, and thought to myself that he was probably having doubts too and that I could discuss it with him. Although I never got around to that. Then I remember that he and I decided we were going to go to my house and hang out, I also remember thinking to myself that we would have sex or do something intimate. We left but then somehow we were no longer together. I then remember my mom suddenly being in my dream and her and my dad were going to go on some bus tour. I was standing on the sidewalk and looked down the block and could see them getting on the bus together. Then I got on another bus to meet my friend Chyrise. She was on the bus and I sat down to talk to her and told her about Kory another friend of mine in real life who suddenly became the character who I was with earlier, even though that was someone else. That's about all I remember. Ironically enough, he and I never did make it back to my apartment and nothing intimate happened, go FIGURE!!!!\n",

      "56 I had a really strange dream last night. I dreamt that Mom and Dad were in Canada, and they were going to drive down and come and get me and go back to the cabin and they did. And Mom drove down, and she said that Dad was waiting at the cabin and we were trying to get stuff together, and she was looking for her little personal tape player unit, and she could not find it. So we just started out the door and we started driving, and all of a sudden Dad appeared in the passenger seat. Now I remember. We were driving to the cabin, and we got to the cabin and Dad stressed the importance of being quiet and stuff. And some force made me turn on the sound equipment, it happened to be in a room in the cavern that looks just like my workroom, and I could not turn it off. I clicked the power switch off, but the sound was still blasting at full level. So then I had to stop the CD player and try and turn it off. Last night I had a funny dream. First of all I dreamt that I was in the Devil Vision room with Elizabeth and we were going to take a test in there for some reason. And we were coming out and the librarian sees us coming out and she comes to talk to us. And Elizabeth is teasing and she says 'Yeah, that's Jasmine, messing up your room in there. ' And then we go out a back door and we're in this field thing, and then I'm with Mom, and I was trying to find a place to practice my song for chorus and not have anybody listening. I'm tired; can you tell? sigh There were these kids around and so I ca not. I stand up on this tall thing and I start singing, and then all of a sudden I'm in this church and I'm auditioning in front of Mrs. Dougherty and Mr. Henderson. And they give me a song that's completely out of my range and I keep screwing up and stuff. And I have a microphone and the board is right behind me and I'm trying to adjust things to make me sound a little bit better. Then I woke up.\n",

      "Ok in this dream I found a new job, but I was just trying the job out for a day, had not actually quit my other job. I show up at this place, it's like one big room with all these desks. The company is owned by this really young guy. It seems they have created an online role playing game and my job will be to help support it. I sit down at this desk, there are 3 other people there. They all seem cool and we start talking. I ask how much they make, and the girl across from me said about 200,000 a year. I asked if that was the actual salary, she said no the salary was about 50,000 but that the owner of the company always gives them bonuses and perks making the value much more. Damn that's some kinda perks. I looked up at the tv and there was this music video it was the guy from Adema who also happened to be sitting next to me and a girl. The girl in the video was the one sitting across from me. I was like you guys are in a band, wondering why the hell they would be working there. They said yes and that they had a show that weekend but it was sold out, I told them if they got tickets to let me know. Then we all went outside and their was this giant water slide across the street, everyone always went for a quick ride on their break. I hung back and talked to the owner telling him that I could probably make their website a lot better too, he seemed to like that. Everyone comes back in and we all sit down. The owner plays a scene from a Julia Roberts movie and we all had to write some kinda of caption about it. What that had to do with anything, I do not know. I remember I was trying to write the words I WILL and I could not seem to write them too clearly typical dream sign. Then some girls came up to me and said they had seen what I had written and it was very good. Then we all had to read what we had written. When my time came I picked up my paper and looked down and there was all this text that I do not remember writing. I start reading it but for some reason this always happens in dream, surprised I didnt become lucid I could not read it and finally gave up. There was this other guy there and I asked him how he liked the job, he said it was ok but that he would rather make more money then have all the perks. I had to go to the bathroom and while I was in there these 2 girls came up and peeked under the stall, and then said something to the effect that they knew me. When I came out we started talking and I was clueless as to who they were. They seemed to imply we went to elementary school together, but when I asked what school they went to it was not the same one I went to. One girl was really short and kinda cute, hispanic looking, the other girl was black. We walked down to what looked like a MINI stadium. I showed them where my seats were for the tickets I had gotten for the Family Values Tour. They were like, Wow great seats. Then I walk back over to this other area and this girl who I used to go to church with named Christine was sitting there. I said Hi Christine and we hugged. I said something to the affect that the pastor would not be happy that she was here since it was a SECULAR music thing. I do not remember what she said. Then I realized it was about 2pm and I had not called my boss from my REAL job to tell him I was not coming in. I was hoping he just had not noticed. I start walking towards my mom's house and was trying to think about what I could say to my boss when I called him. I was very stressed over it. I then woke up for real and saw it was light out and thought I had overslept. But I had not.\n",

And first Mom and Sheryl and Sandra would go off these steps and I was yelling after them, 'No, do not go that way!' And so then they came down and we were swimming in this pool, and the side of it had these slime plastic spike things that, if you would put your hand on them, you would sink into them and be engulfed in them, your hand would be, and you'd never know what would happen in the pool. And so finally we were out of there somehow and there were all these people and everything. And this people. mover thing, we found out that Sam was now an officer and we were on this people. mover thing and it went to this hotel room.

      "101 Last night I had a dream that Dad took me to the radio station where I'm going to intern and just kind of set me loose to explore around. And I came to this big foyer area that had a white floor and a big huge Christmas tree, and there were carolers sitting and this elderly woman who was directing them, kind of like Barbara. And I went over to her and I talked to her, and she was this really high soprano that could hit this high B. flat, and she could not understand why I could not. And so I told her that, I told her to tell Mom and Dad to meet at the big Christmas tree at 700 o'clock. And then she kind of led us on this tour thing, and we went into this other foyer that had carpeting and there were like boxes and stuff all piled all over everywhere. And she watched me go into this other little room where I had to climb over boxes to get to her, and there was like a broadcast booth and I sat there in the back. And it turned out that this is Elizabeth's car and it's not a transmitter, but a receiver in there. And Elizabeth's car drives away and drives back home. And Dad says, 'She was sitting over there till we got there. ' Then I had this subordinate dream that my watch said 748 in the morning when I was supposed to have been out the door at 700, and Bobby's clock said 200 in the morning, and I could not read the time on mine. And I went clear to the microwave and the microwave said 200 in the morning. That was weird; I did not know exactly what time it was.\n",

      "113 I had a dream that I was in Spain with Mom and Dad, and somehow we got our car over there and we were riding on a bus, and we were riding back to our hotel where our car was. And I was asking the bus driver in Spanish where this mountain with these carvings on it was so that we could drive over to it. And I was constantly translating for Mom and Dad in different places. And then we were in our car and it was like we were driving through an amusement park. It was all kinds of stuff, only it was all in Spanish. And I was constantly translating. And then next thing I knew we were in this auditorium watching this show, and again it was all in Spanish because we were supposed to be in Spain. And the person next to us who was giving us these candies, this box of candy called Blue Bird Song Candies, and it was the oddest, dumbest thing. And then I thought that I had woken up, but I was still dreaming, so I was basically dreaming of waking up. And I dreamt that I was telling Mom what a scary, scary dream I had. And she said, 'You have scary dreams almost every two weeks. '\n",

      "173 Last night I had a dream, like Martin Luther King. Well, I'm expecting a surprise visit from my sister Sandra tomorrow, but I do not know what in the world or when in the world because they will not tell me. So anyway, I had this dream that Sandra was here and I was telling her the story of we set up the keyboard on the kitchen counter, of all things, and it was white, the body was white and it was twice the size. I put my two hands on it. There was enough span for the bass clef and the treble clef, and I started playing the accompaniment for Easy Like Sunday morning. And Sandra was like, 'Wow, girl!' And Dad was out in the yard and he could hear it, and then here comes the really bizarre part. We were getting ready to go to this thing at the city Performing Arts Center and Sandra and Dad wanted to go with us, but I guess they were not ready. I was just like in the car in the passenger seat, and the car was just going where I needed it to go. And it was just going on the interstate, 70 mph and it got off the exit at the right exit, and the only problem I had that it needed to be driven was when it came time to park, and since I was not steering it, it parked kind of cockeyed across three other spaces. And it was twirling around a little tiny bit. And I shut off the ignition just in time before it crashed into something. And oh, when I was on the interstate, I could see around me, everybody in the truck behind me. I could see Mom and Sandra in the truck behind me, and so when I got parked, shortly after that Mom pulled up in the truck. And I had to tell her how cockeyed the car parked, and Sandra was there and I did not want Dad to know that I 'drove' even though I did not drive all by myself. And we were going to race home and get him, but we decided, 'Nah,' and I do not remember too much after that, but I do remember that we were all at this like camp fire celebration with these fireworks going off later on. And then I woke up.\n",

      "Ok i remember just one part of this dream. We are leaving to go somewhere and we are in the car. I do not remember who i was with but get the feeling it was my family. As we come to this bridge which looks like it has a toll i remember i forgot something at home. So we have to turn around. Here is the wild part. I am sitting in the car looking ahead and the bridge goes STRAIGHT up to the point where it is SO steep it looks like a rollercoaster hill. i see cars going up it though, although in real life there is no way cars could get up this steep hill. we drive up this huge hill and i am freaking out thinking we are going to fall, we get to the first toll and turn around. well now we have to go over the huge hill yet again. This time its not like a hill but its like a draw bridge where part of the road is lifted straight up. So we ride up but are going too slow so reverse back down. Then we pick up speed and ride up it again when we get to the top we have to go over about a 1 foot section before coming back down the other side. I dont know how we made it but we did. Thats all i remember. It was freaky.\n",

      "187 Last night I dreamt that I had a sleepless night, but I really slept really well. I dreamt that I was listening to the clock radio some more and Mom was talking to me, and we checked it before I went to sleep. But I could not get it to shut off, and I was trying all kinds of different things like make sure the s function's off, make sure the alarm's off, make sure the switch is off. I could not get it to turn off. I had to like take it apart just to make it shut off so I could go to sleep, and then I was really frustrated. And then I remember I came down to the couch with Mom, where we had the system on, and Dad was there and he started talking to us and we were having like a family conference at 1130 at night. And then she was going to the swing, and I was getting back to bed. And then I remember being at this reception hall  I've been having dreams about that lately. But, you know what it was? We were at my tech school taking a tour and we had this  it was Elizabeth, me, Mom and Angel, I think  we had this really funny elevator we had to keep going up and down. And we were in the lobby that looked like the reception hall where we had the wedding, and then we came down this funny elevator and we landed in the parking garage, supposedly go into another building. And we saw Mrs. Hammondacross the parking lot, which is the lady who gave me the four. year degree lecture several times. And we just waved and smiled, and she said, 'Are you here seeing the school?' and I woke up before I could answer.\n",

And so when they were in the parking garage, everybody was oohing and ahhhing over their car and stuff, like they always do, and for some reason we had all of my equipment set up outside, and I had to bring it inside because it was going to rain. And I just took it one piece at a time and started bringing it inside, but I did not get too far because Mrs. Dubois came over and said she was going out of town. And her daughter wondered if I wanted some Halloween things that she had. And then I woke up.\n",

      "202 I just woke up from a dream I was having and I have a real clear recollection of it. I dreamt that we were at Tyme Gardens; well, no. I dreamt that we were at a carnival thing like in somebody's parking lot, like and it was almost dusk and we were riding these rides. There were only a few of them. I cannot remember exactly what they did, but I remember we were riding some rides and it's too many in my dream, and it was really, really fun. And then we were at home and for some reason Dad had some errands to do or something, so he was hanging like that in the truck and would drive away for like half hour to an hour increments, I do not know, something like that. And I was setting up to jam in my studio. Of course the task  board is on my desk now, but here's, Mom gave me this fresh set of batteries from somewhere and they were fresh and there was no ones in her boom box. And the next, oh boy, this is getting just all fragmented, is not it? Mom was fixing supper and it was going to be on any minute, but I had to do it, so I put this sign on my door, 'Do not enter, surprise things. ' And I tested out the keyboard again with the fresh set of batteries Mom gave me, and lo and behold, it worked beautifully. And I set it up on the stool, the black stool, since my desk was taken over by the task  board, and I do not remember too much of what my session was like, but I do remember feeling really, really good that it was resurrected again. Of course, when I woke up, I realized it was only a dream, and I was like, 'Oh man!' But this is one of these dreams that really gives you a good feeling when you wake up, just all around. The rides were fun, everything was fun, and it feels like sings a little song ' in the song I sing today . You're in my dreams at night, and when I rise, there's a  of my slumber. You're never out of thought. ' The best I could sing at 430 in the morning.\n",

      "216 Last night I had a dream that Mom and Dad went out for the evening and I had some things to do while they were out. First of all I was putting some CD's in the CD player and I was going to dance and stuff like I usually do. Then I had this notion that I had to go out to get something; I do not remember where it was or what I had to do, but I had to go somewhere. So I got in the car, I started it up and I sat in the back seat, and it just took off from there and it just sort of knew where I wanted to go. And it stopped and it parked itself in the parking lot when we got there. Like I said, I do not remember what it was, but I remember getting out and talking to somebody in the parking lot and being real afraid because I do not look like I'm of age to drive. Then by the time it was time for me to come home, it was dark and I was really afraid because I was going to crash somewhere. And again, I started it up and I sat in the big seat with this  thing, and it just sort of knew when to stop at this traffic light and knew where to turn  that was so crazy! But when we got to Allison's, we were almost home and we were coming down 5th Street, and we were at Allison's and it just sort of stopped in front of her house. And Megan came up to me and started asking questions, and I did not want to start it up and move it home because Megan was right there and she would think it's funny. And so after talking to Megan, I just walked home and I put the boom box out on the front lawn and played some CD's and I sat in the green chair. And then I woke up.\n",

      "Going to post these together since they happened the same night and had a common theme, although were completely different. Dream1 First dream I only remember a small part. I am at the airport with my brother who is dead in RL and some other person. We are flying back to Washington. We get to the gate to check in and on the board I do not see the flight for DCA. So I remember getting a bit stressed thinking the flight had been cancelled for something. Then the lady told us the flight was still taking off so we checked in. Then I remember her saying she was hungry or something, so my brother offered to go get some food. I was going to go with him but he took off ahead of me. I walk out into this section where there are corridors going off in like 5 different directions. I do not know which way he has gone so I just scream STEVE!!!!!!. I wait and then scream STEVE!!!!!! again. FInally I hear him respond. I keep screaming his name until he finds me and then I wake up. Dream 2 I am with 2 girls and we are trying to get to the airport. I remember intially this one girl was driving and we were going down some windy road, then she remembered that she had forgotten something and we had to go back. Then suddenly I am driving and we are once again going down this windy road. Then suddenly the car falls off the road almost as if the road came to an end and went down about 30 feet. So the car goes head first and we hit the pavement. I remember hitting my nose on the ground, as if there was no windshield on the car. It was also a very small car like a VW Bug or something. Everyone had fallen out of the car, one girl had a baby with her but it did not get injured. We picked up the car yes we picked it up LOL and set it up right and got back in. Then I am on my old street where my mom lives. I tell them I am going to run in to see if she can take us to the airport, we were short on time. She opens the door up and we had a very short conversation and she basically said she would not drive us. I distinctly remember saying Well FUCK YOU then! and she replied FUCK YOU TOO and i walked off. LOL That's all I remember, we never did get to the airport though. I have had a lot of dreams over the years dealing with making it to the airport on time, or missing a flight etc, not sure why. I have never missed a flight before, although I have flown quite a bit when i was younger because my dad was a pilot of American Airlines. But in the last 10 years I have only flown about 8. 10 times. Very odd.\n",

      "Ok I definitely do not remember all of this dream but I will recall what I can. I remember my dad was in the dream, for some reason I think I was in california. He said he had bought me a truck and was going to give it to me. So we get ready to get in the elevator. I got in and for some reason no one else made it into the elevator. Before the door even closed the elevator went plunging to the bottom floor. It was going so fast that I was stuck to the ceiling of the elevator by the force. I remember feeling the sensation of falling. It slowed down when we reached the lobby and I landed on my feet and walked out. I remember seeing the manager there and telling her that the elevator was broken, see seemed frustrated that it was broken again. Suddenly my dad was there again and said he was going to go get the truck. So I waited outside for him, kind of in this alley but he never showed. So I walked back into the hotel and went out the front but still did not see him anywhere. I do not remember how this part concluded but I think I finally found him. It was one of this BIG pick up trucks, looked brand new, and was maroon. For some reason, even though he was giving me this truck he would not let me drive it, I was not sure why. Then I started to wonder how I would get the truck back from California to Virginia. I was thinking I could drive but it would take more than 2 days, so I was not sure what I was going to do. I went on to think about why would my dad just be giving me this truck? Something must be in it for him. At that point my dad and the truck were no longer in the dream. I remember talking to some lady and she told me that it was just some big conspiracy, with my dad trying to give me this truck. I do not remember the details though. Next I remember seeing this black man. He was using some type of tool, like a hammer and some big metal spike, he was beating the spike into some metal, it was like a big flat piece of shiny sheet metal. He was creating some type of design, however he was doing it to a rhytmic beat. It was almost as if he was a performance artist, yet creating art at the same time. I was just observing him. Then I was at some playground and again I was just observing. There was this little black kid who was on a seesaw all by himself. His brother was on one next to him but obviously did not want to play with him. Then I hear kind of like a narrator who starts talking about this boy and explaining that he is kind of socially misfit. He talks about how the boy goes on to some private school and then ends up becoming a good kid. Odd. I remember one final scene in the dream that had something to do with the Sopranos but I really cannot remember specifics.\n",

      "Ok I only remember bits and peices, although I know why I had most of this dream you can read my comments below. Because I was so tired I did not remember it all. I remember some situation where I kept getting called or paged and had to drive somewhere to fix an issue. I think it happened a few times so I was getting mad, it was night time and i was very tired. I remember feeling very tired in the dream. I cannot for the live of me remember many details about this part. I do remember that i was finally ready to go home and go back to sleep but the person I was with was going to have to stop at some store. I remember thinking that last time he ended stopping at a bunch of stores and I wanted to get home. So I asked and made sure we were only going to stop at the one. Then I am at home, although not my home but it was in the dream. I am in the living room and my cat starts freaking out he hops up on the table and gets on his hind legs and is looking up at this light fixture. Something starts to come out of it. At first it looks like bugs, then I think it looks like bats. Of course if you think something in your dream it tends to go that route. So the small bug like creatures grew into bats. Although their heads were much bigger then normal and a bit animated. One of them was looking at me and kinda smiling. Then I was like, wait a minute this is not possible this has to be a dream. However I did not become lucid instead I woke up in my bed yet still dreaming, and was like whew just a dream. LOL dammit. Then some guy is in bed with me not sure who he was. We were kissing or something and I remember looking at his back and seeing this really huge scar right above his butt. In the dream I seemed to know why the scar was there and therefore it did not bug me. It was as if it was the first time I was seeing it. Then I peek under the covers and I see that he is jacking off, I find it strange seeing that I was right there I would have gladly helped LOL and he actually had an orgasm, it was a bit odd in the dream. That was it I then woke up.\n",

      "Ok I remember bits and pieces of this dream. Bit 1. I am in my mom's house. Some guy comes over i knew him with some black girl. Everything seems ok but then the black chicks starts walkin through the house going through things. This pissed me off, I was like, What the fuck do you think you're doing? She just kept right on. I was on the phone with my mom and told her I was gonna call the police, the girl heard me but it did not seem to phase her. I think she was in my mom's bedroom by this point. Not sure what happened after that. Bit 2. I am still at my mom's house. It's night time. I look outside and there are 3 cars driving up the street. One slams on his breaks and then the other 2 collide. They were all really big cars like Lincoln Town Cars or something, one was black, not sure what color the others were. Then the people who were in the cars are at my door. I beleive I recognized them as good friends of the family, although I do not remember much else about that. Bit 3. I am at my friend Chyrise's house. We must have been out somewhere together because we were arriving at her door together. She opened the door and her bathroom was straight back although it is not really set up that way. Her husband was standing in the bathroom with a button down shirt and some boxers on, holding his pants. He seemed embarrassed and ran upstairs. Now we are in her house and I remember some white kid being there and that it was her husband's son. The kid had blonde hair. Although her husband is black. The kid had some friend sleeping over as well. At one point in the dream I must have complained that my back hurt and Chyrise gave me this massage thing that I put in the drivers seat of my car to massage my back while I drive.\n",

      "I am driving my car my red celica down the street. I approach a red light and the car in front of me it looked like a really small white car and there was a puppy in it stopped short. I ended up bumping the car slightly. I was like oh shit now their gonna get out of the car and we will have to report it. But instead she must have taken her foot off the break because she moved forward and an oncoming car slammed into her. Her car went flying into a ditch. Then from an observer over top point of view I saw her lying there on the ground unconscious. I am back in my car and thinking of whether or not I should pull over. I decide against it because I am worried that I will get in trouble. Then I think about the fact that what if someone reports my car and license plate to the police, they may come after me later. Then I think that no one else saw so it should be ok and i decide to drive on, feeling guilty. I arrive home my mom's house and it turns out I am going to be on that MTV show The Real World. Although some of the other people that were going to be on the show were previous cast members. The guy Puck was going to be one of them. Then some people from MTV came over there were some other girls at my house there as well, friends of mine I guess and they were asking if I was going to wear what I had on. I said no I had to go change. I go upstairs and start looking for clothes. I am looking for a nice pair of black slacks and finally find some. I put them on and then when I look in the mirror I realize they are shorts. So I find another pair and was also looking for this really nice red and black shirt. Then my room suddenly looks like my old bedroom that I was in when I grew up. Suddenly all these people come down the hall to the bedroom door. I quickly shut the door not wanting to let them in. There was one girl in the room with me but that was it. Then I open the door and ask what they want. I think they wanted to come in but I would not let them, one of them appeared to be my pastor's wife of the church I used to go to long ago. Finally they leave. That's all I remember.\n",

And I dreamt that we had to go to this bus travel seminar March 17th, and then I dreamt that big yawns I had attended a bus thing at school and the internship ladies were reading like these dumb little things that you had to answer yes or no on your application. And then I dreamt that me and some other girl were singing in the living room to this Christmas music. We were trying to put 'Away In a Manger' to a rap beat! And my voice was like the only voice that could not be heard. I could not sing out for some reason, I do not know why. It was like I could not sing out. And after that I woke up.\n",

And we were supposed to drive him somewhere and she wanted us to drive him in their car because Tweetie felt more comfortable in it, she said. And the make of her car was a Tweetie. And it was this minivan like type thing and it had real complicated circuitry, secondary circuits in it. You had to like insert your key and do a special little thing to move the seats forward and back, which was what she did for Mom. And we were going through this drive. through Happy Meal fast food place, and we were just sitting and sitting and sitting. This line took forever. And while we were sitting Mom was kind of doing some messing around in the front and I was sitting with Tweetie in the back.

      "Ok I was at this ski lodge, I am assuming it was at least. There was this really cute baby about a year old, dark hair and eyes, looked hispanic I had seen one on tv that looked just like her during the day. So this little baby was sick and some blonde girl recommended some specific medicine. Then I mentioned that the baby had asthma, although she was not currently weasing. Then I put my hand on her chest and felt it rattling and said oh she is weasing. I said that there was asthma medication at my house and I volunteered to take the baby, not sure whose it was. So I put the baby in a chair and leave it there and go outside i would never do such a thing LOL. I went outside and there was a group of people. It was a ski resort and there was snow all around. It was night time although the place was well lit. I over heard one guy tell another guy they should go to switzerland, as if it were close by. Then he mentioned they should go to some other place staring with a C. It was this hill near by. So I decided to check it out. I am standing atop this hill. It's snow covered. I decide to lay down on my stomach and slide down it. I start down the hill and feel the sensation of sliding down. As I get to the bottom there is this huge puddle of mud, lovely. Although I do not remember getting dirty. Some guy had followed me and slid down too. We were both laughing and raced back up the hill, I barely beat him. Then someone tugs my arm. It was Shawn Cook, someone I used to go to church with. He walked back to the lodge with me, because I mentioned I had to get the baby. When we walked in the baby was on the floor. Then I remember hearing someone say the baby fell out of the chair. I played it off and said something to the effect that I did not know where the person I left the baby with was, even though I did not leave the baby with anyone. A woman was sitting on the ground with the baby as we got closer. I took the baby and headed home. I got home and baby was now my old cat Rosco. I was trying to find this special food that he had to eat for his med. I also had a pill I was supposed to give him but was not sure how. Someone comes in so I rushed to get dressed. Then I go outside and my dad is there he was nice in this dream. He was there and he had all these cakes. There were other people with him. There was this huge chocolate frosted chocolate cupcake that I was eyeing so I took it. Yum. There were all these other mini cakes one was white with cocoa powder on top and some others. We were all sitting down eating. Then I see my pastor drive up at the gas station. I was just sitting there looking at him, secretly hoping he would love over and notice me. He did not. So I yelled out Mr. Mills which is funny since i always addressed him as pastor mills, guess I felt he did not deserve that title. He looked over as I drove off. I went back to the house and then the people I had been with followed. This one girl came in and I asked if he my pastor had followed her, she said no. She told me that he had come up to them and said I do not know you people quite rudely and then walked off. Then I remember I was writing something, and thinking on the verge of tears that maybe I should go back to christianity, back to the church because I liked the way it felt when I was there. I liked the unity and the feeling of belonging. thats what its all about emotion, you get sucked in by the things you FEEL which can be very deceiving. I go back outside and the cake eating party is still going on. I notice this small square chocolate cake. It was in a plastic container. My friend Dee Dee from highschool was sitting in front of it. I asked her what it was and she said something, do not remember. I asked her if it was anything like flan and she said no. Suddenly my pastors wife shows up. She said that she told him the pastor that it had been me who said his name. I asked her if i had ever explained to her why I never came back to the church. She said yes, but then I said but did I REALLY tell you the truth? Then something distracted her and I was trying to get her attention. Then I woke up.\n",

      "273 Last night I had a semi. scary dream. First of all I dreamt that I was reading this long epic poem, kind of like the, it was written in the style of the Odyssey, except it was only about an eighth of the length. It was the story in epic poem fashion, and it was about this lady who saw a monster in her swimming pool and it tried to drown her, and from then she was extremely scared of monsters, and what she did and all. And I think one of the lines went something like, 'One time I had this,' I mean, at one point I had this picture in my head of a lady sitting in the bathtub, leaning over the edge and doing some sewing. And the poem read for those lines, 'And the monster of the water came up and bit off a piece of her head. ' And that was real weird, and she was like freaking out because she was so scared of this monster. And I can remember that I kind of like, they were talking about the monster of the water all through this poem, but the last line said something about the monster of Oof. That was weird. And I dreamt that I actually saw the monster in the swimming pool, and I jumped in the swimming pool, for whatever reason. And there was ice around the pool there and it was shallow for a swimming pool. And there was this big guy who was like running around and trying to drown me, but I'm a good, strong swimmer and I got away from him. And then I dreamt that I tried to get out of the bus without my cane and stuff, and I did not know what the heck bus I was really on, and I did not have my go card ? and it was just a bad deal.

And I was walking around upstairs in these people's house, and walking back and forth on this point. There were some Christmas decorations, display figures, up there, and I was talking to, oh no, I was looking down at all the people coming in and I thought I would go down and say hi, so I did. And the next thing I knew, we were in a boat, or we were getting ready to go on a boat with some of the people, and the engine would not start and I was sitting there on the boat with a boom box. The engine would not start and there was this certain tour boat starter thing that made a lot of noise that would start the engine, but first I wanted to get off the boat and go walk around on this little island in the main group while they were doing that. And so I got Mom to take care of the boom box, and I got up and I guess at that moment I woke up.\n",

We must have lived in some apartment complex because there was this huge court yard in the middle that had these enormous 6. 7 stories tall art structures, one was like a big circle. Anyway, when the bomb went off the structures fell into the building. The ceiling of my room collapsed. I remember thinking I was going to die. I was pinned under this structure but was some how able to squeeze out. I realized we had to get out, we had birds and I was asking my dad what we should do with the birds, we decided we should set them free so at least they would have a chance, I opened the window and let the birds go. Now we are in some little vehicle, kinda like a golf cart, trying to get out of the building. We get to the elevator and see that it's completely obstructed, yet somehow we get out. Then we are all going to pile into a car. I see my cat remmy outside and he looks extremely scared, he is running around all confused, kinda crouched down. I call him and he sees me and runs over. We get in the car and start to drive off, then I realize my mom is not there. I said something like where's mom and no one responded. I was very upset and yelled HEY!!!!!!!. I obviously said it in my sleep because I woke myself up screaming HEY!!! I felt very uneasy upon waking up yet at the same time did not want to lose the dream, I feel immediately back to sleep. Now I am standing on the street alone because I got out of the car since they left my mom. I found my cell phone sitting on the ground, I saw it did not have much power left. I called my mom's cell phone and she answered. I asked where she was and she told me the place do not remember it. I asked her how I was supposed to get there and she explained. THen I repeated the name of the place back to her. I was very worried we would not be able to connect. Then I am in a hotel. I am waiting for my mother, when she comes we are going to go to California where it is safer. I nap and then some lady comes over, she is a hair dresser and says she will be back shortly to do my hair, she never comes back though and this frustrates me. My mom finally calls and I ask her when she is coming and she says she will be there soon. THen I woke up.\n",

      "I was somewhere and found out Godsmack tickets were on sale ironically tickets did go onsale today for a show in boston i didnt find this out until after the dream. ANyway I was going to purchase the tickets for 5 of us. I was doing it online. It was a cool system because it showed where the seats would be. I found out that if we got 5 seats together we would be in the 161st row, yet if we split it up with 2 seats and 3 seats we would be in like the 3rd row. So I went that route. I went and told my friends what tickets I got and they seemed upset that I did not get all the tickets seated together. I explained that I wanted a good seat, I did not want to be 100 rows back from the stage. I remember we fought about it awhile but finally agreed. I guess the tickets were not going to be officially purchased until I logged back on and did something. I tried to get online and could not so I went home to access the internet from there. I believe I was able to get online. Now I am at home, my mom's house, and she says that she is having some party tonight and that I had to attend. I must have been a teenager because it was as if I had no choice. I was really mad because I did not want to go to the stupid party. Now I am viewing the dream in 3rd person. The person who was me is now this teenage girl, blonde hair. She was getting dressed for the party, she put on a blue and white shirt and a long red skirt how patriotic something I would not have chosen. Then she goes outside and sees these 2 girls in the street screaming for help, these other guys are attacking them. I am first person again and I am walking towards them. I had a water gun but it was filled with hair dye. One of the guys started walking towards me and I began to squirt the hair dye in his face and eyes, he started screaming because it burned. Finally they ran off. That's all I remember.\n",

      "I am with some guy, we approach his car, it was an old VW bug. I ask if I could drive since I had not driven stick in awhile. He says ok. We walk to the car and the passenger window is down. On the window sill there are ice creams and sodas, we throw them again. Now suddenly there are 4 of us, myself, another girl and 2 guys. I was like, all 4 of you can not come back to my mom's house! Then we started driving. There was a black truck with 2 black guys driving. One of them was hiding his face partially with a scarf and partially with his arm. They were pointing at one of the male passengers in our car and wanted us to pull over. Fuck that! Now suddenly I was not driving anymore I was in the front passenger seat giving directions. I knew we were near my mom's house and I knew there was a police station near by. I tell him where to go and he pulls out into on coming traffic and we almost get hit. Now we are under some bridge and I tell them to pull over I know a short cut. THey pull over and we all get out. We go up this stair case and come out in this shopping center. We run into this building, not sure what it was really but it was not the police station. We run into those one man who asked us something, then we leave the building. He comes out after us and told us where the police station was, but I said it was quicker if we go this way. Some other kid follows us out saying we left a mess in the bathroom. I tell him we are on our way to the police station and that we would come back to clean it up after. I point to a gift shop and we see they are open, I mention that if we go in there and go out the back way the police station is right near there. I go through the door of the giftshop, which is now a window. As I climb through the window it looks more like someone's townhouse. The portion we are climbing through is like an upper loft and you can hear people on the floor below us. I go down to the first floor and look back up where my friends are still coming in. Then I spot the black guy that had been chasing us. Shit! I tell a woman on the first floor that she needs to go get the cops, she runs out of the house to get the police. After a moment I run out the front door and there is this big black guy standing out there, and tells me I'm not going anywhere. Damn. I decide to stay out in front of the house with the guy. I get the impression my friends inside are being forced to do sexual things. Then the guy out front starts to touch me and makes me very uncomfortable. A cop and security guard walk up and asks if everything is ok. I felt, for whatever reason, that if I said what was going on something bad would happen. So I said everything was fine but I was trying to speak to them with my eyes and let them know there was definitely a problem. The cop finally leaves, I was hoping he would come back. No lots of people are inside and my friends are being forced to perform sexual acts, I cannot really see what's going on. The black guy outside grabs me and keeps me close to him, he continues to feel me up and molest me. Oddly enough in the dream it turned me on yet at the same time I was scared and very uncomfortable, there was nothing I could do. I see one of my friends start to get dressed, she was talking to some females inside the house. They seemed friendly. The guy that had been out front with me was now sitting on the couch next to some white girl. I look for my shirt, I guess it was not on me, and put it on. We start to leave and the black guy who was outside with me implies he is coming with me. Although this time I do not feel threatened. He pretty much says he was just doing his job but that he really wanted to get to know me. We walk across the street and see the brother of one of the guys I was with and ask him for a ride. Then I woke up.\n",

      "285 Last night I dreamt that we were at this Great Exploration exhibit or some kind of fair thing, but it was inside. And there were all these various things, and there was an area that said 'Teachers,' but it should have been 'Singers,' because they had a Sade display, they had a A display, they had a Celine Dion display and they had a bunch of other displays, and there were a few rides and a few little movie things going on. And I was there with Mom. Before they showed the exhibit  I cannot remember what it looked like, though  and we saw the Celine Dion exhibit  well, actually the Shaday exhibit was kind of elegant, kind of nice. The Celine Dion exhibit was kind of blah. It was set up on a table and it was a board, this round wooden board, and there was this real cheap, short, stout chinsy plastic figure of her holding a guitar. And there was this magnet and this magnet would move her around the board as the song My Heart Will Go On would play on this blah thing that was there. There was a whole other room that we had not gotten to yet, but there was this red door that said, 'Teacher's Exit' and I had the notion that when you go out it, it would make an alarm sound. So it would go into like in a kitchen thing. Oh, I know, all of a sudden I had my CD writer there, and I am recording something, the machine freezes like it did for me yesterday. It keeps getting hotter and hotter and hotter, then I realize that we started a fire. So we were running around now in the house, so we're running around and we do not know what to do, but the porch is like really long. Remember the teacher's exit, I tell Mom, 'Open the door and run out,' but she does not. We just run out the back door to avoid all that, and I think she gets it under control before it really turns into anything major. And then I woke up.\n",

      "291 I've been having a little bit of a dream dry spell, but last night I had a pretty really neat dream. I dreamt that Dad had bought me this Little Mermaid videotape because it was on sale at Blockbuster, and it was not the original story, but it was kind of like a side little story  not necessarily a sequel, just kind of like another story. And so we sat down and we were watching it, and we had the surround sound turned on, and I went up close to see it, and of all things Flounder and Ariel were at a casino gambling and Flounder was like putting money down with his fins. And there was like all kinds of flashing lights and stuff going on , and there were these other mer. people there that were like doing the same thing. And then all of a sudden, in the middle of their like card game, I guess it was, Ursula comes in and like waves her magic wand and makes everybody like silent and still. And Ariel and Flounder managed to escape because the other mer. people turned to stone, and then all of a sudden I'm like in the movie and I'm at this like Adventure Island kiddie pool, and this girl who's kind of dressed like a mermaid is saying, 'Jasmine, come this way; you're going the wrong way. ' And I'm trying to remember what else was in it. I do not remember too much else. And that's all I remember unfortunately. I did not have time to take this down this morning and now it's like 24 hours later, I guess, oh no, it was like a few. Now I'm all confused. Well anyway, you get the gist.\n",

      "302 Last night I had a dream that we had taken a car trip up to California to see Jack and Polly for a family reunion, and this is so weird  you'd never believe it. Dad said when he was snooping around out back he found these alligators trying to get at these chickens, and a few of them were dead already, but the alligators were in the water and the chickens were up on the thing. And he got two or three of the chickens out of the way, and I cannot remember, one of them had like chicken wire wrapped around its ankle, and I do not remember what all the ruckus was about, but I think it was that somebody like fell in the water and they like jumped out, but Aunt Polly saved Mr. Thomas and Mrs. Dougherty. That was weird. And we were all like packed into their bedroom, just talking and visiting and chatting and yakking and carrying on, and Dad's laying there on the bed totally exhausted, wanting to go to sleep. And here we are visiting and talking and carrying on. And so it was really, it was Jack and Polly and all of our family and we were like having a family thing. And then I dreamt that  oh, I know  somehow we were supposed to have taken a trip up to their house, but somehow I had the notion that our sound system was in their living room, and Jack and Carl and Mom were watching a movie. And I was going to tell Jack how the system is wired, but I never got around to it. But then I dreamt that Mom and I went to this park to swing on their swings, and one of them came undone because she was trying to figure out where Ohio is. How dumb! And also we went to this library because I needed some kind of book on psychology or something, and I turned the  and had to go to a big philosophy library that was right next door. And we were set off to drive all the way back to my home state, and then I woke up.\n",

      "I had a dream that I was giving a tour of my high school. When I entered the chapel, it was pitch black and I could see nothing except for this little boy with a laptop. He jumped up to greet me and then launched into this discussion of wireless Internet on campus. He wanted to show me how it worked, so he turned some of the lights on really dim. I was shocked to see about 10 other people in the pews, all really old and like the boy with laptops. He went into all these programs and messed around on the computer until the lights shut off of their own accord, indicating that he was now connected to the Internet. I was surprised and impressed and had lost my tour. But it did not bother me. I went downstairs to the mailroom to find everyone happy and excited, all carrying or eating candies and chocolates, all with roses and dressed in pink. They all said, Happy Valentines Day to me. I was surprised because I had no idea it was Valentines Day. It was really dark so I could not find my mailbox, yet I could see all my friends with their stuff. As I finally started opening my mailbox, Leah explained to me how much candy she had received and who had given her roses and such. I opened my box to find only 5 pieces of candy. Feeling rejected, I walked back upstairs where it was light again. I remember hearing this voice behind me calling my name, and I looked behind me to see Sam running toward me with one rose. He gave it to me and kissed my cheek before leaving. Puzzled, I went back to my dorm, where I fell asleep really quickly. I was woken late that night because the fire alarm rang. Hannah and I ran out of the room to a secret hallway I never new about before. We were all to wait there until a train picked us up to bring us to safety. So when the train finally came pirates who had stolen it controlled it. They kidnapped everyone but me. I had to run and hide in a nearby bathroom. When they came looking for me, I cut them with razors and sprayed their eyes with hairspray, and basically defeated them with beauty products weird. Then I woke up.\n",

      "328 Last night I had a dream that I was back home again, and I was on my s upstairs and we had somehow I was getting to have all these tons of things on my hard drive, and I needed the space for audio and I did not know how these things were getting on there. And I, you know how sales people call sometimes and they solicit their marketing and stuff? Well, this girl called the house and she was selling things, and I started asking her a bunch of questions about things and she did not really know the Mac platform that well, but she knew about things  and I thought that maybe the fact that the beautiful angel statue's wing cracked off, I thought that maybe that was screwing up my system somehow. And I told her that, and, of course, she probably thought I was crazy. And she decided she was going to come over to the house to see what I was talking about, and to help me out, and then I kind of, I went online somewhere, which is something I cannot do, and I was trying to download some kind of audio or something, but instead this green dinosaur was getting downloaded and opened and all, and I could not close it. I could not do anything. I had to do a restart to get out of that. And I could not even do that. And then she came over and she was like hanging out in the house for two days, not really doing much. And then I cannot remember, I think we fixed my angel statue, and then her supervisor came, and he was a real nice man that actually knew what he was talking about, and he helped me delete all these things and I was telling him, 'Okay, let's shut down the right way this time. ' And he said, 'Okay, I'll do it with the keys. ' And he actually did it the way you do it for Windows, and I was starting checking on, I was, I guess I was not sure what operating system I was using. And he did the Windows key, the  and the  just like they taught me at the Wilcox Center. And I think there's more to it, but I woke up. I think this came from watching Bobby, how his setup is a little more different than ours, and he knew all these games and stuff. I guess that's what I'm thinking of.\n",

      "329 I had a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad night because Mom was not there; she was out with Larry. But people were still fussing around. Aunt Christine was at the kitchen table, putting packing tape and newspapers in a box, so you can imagine what that sounded like. And then there was all kinds of other stuff going on. And while all that was going on, I kind of fell asleep for maybe ten minutes and I had a dream that Aunt Christine and Mom were going to drive me over to Grandma's house so that I could find a place to sleep. And so we got in her truck and we were driving, and we got there and it was turned into like a store. There were like racks of stuff there and her old carpet and things were still there, but it was all opened up and there was like this store and they were like selling like tourist gifts. And Grammy was there and she was like directing people around, and, of course, fussing like her usual self does. And there were no bedrooms there any more. And I think suddenly I was home in my home state in my room, and I had a feeling that it was not really real, but I went up to my bed and I laid down and I turned on my unit that's by my bed there, and it was so quiet that I had to bring it onto the bed next to me and like lay there and just it was okay. And I'm imagining this, but I just had the feeling that it was not real, that none of this was real. And so then I knew I had to get back to Christine's house, but I do not know what, even though I was kind of going to sleep in my dream, I had to get back to Christine's house. And I was just getting up and getting ready to go back there and then I woke up.\n",

      "331 Last night I had the craziest dream that I've had in a while. Well, not really, but kind of. To start with I do not know if I was up here or in my home state, but I was at this bar with Mom and a few other people, I think one or two of my friends too. And there was this machine there, this vending machine, that you would put a quarter in and you would put a square, rectangular piece of bendy plastic in. It was like three dimensional. And then the machine would play a tune like 'Old MacDonald' or 'London Bridge' or some kids' song like that, while it was making the kid a figure. And it had like a little window where you could watch it through. And I cannot remember, it was not scary, but the machine played 'London Bridges' and 'Blue Bird' and a couple other things like that, but some of them I could not recognize. And I do not know what that had to do with anything, but I also, at this bar I was supposed to set up the sound system and do something, record something, I guess. And I did not have the Peavey system; I had this big clunky thing. And somehow I made a recording with my voice talking over some music that's playing and making some announcements and stuff. And later on I played it back on my personal CD player. And it was so loud, my voice was like clipping, and I could not turn the volume down. It was like almost making me deaf, and it was like making my teeth rattle. And that was kind of crazy. And so I figured, 'Next time I have got to pay more attention to the V meters, and they had these racks of equipment and they had a tape recorder, a CD recorder and a couple other things like the radio station does. And I had to stand on a chair and I still could not see all the meters well enough. So then I kind of woke and went to a different scene. Then I fell back to sleep and I dreamt that Dad came up here. He drove up here and I had another week to go of vacation in my dream. And he kind of like surprised us like Uncle Bob did at the farm that one day. But it was not a real pleasant surprise for me because this vacation is like supposed to be us away from home, and so he drove up here, and I thought, 'Oh no, he's going to be tagging along with us the next week and he's going to rain on our parade. ' And he also saying things like, 'Well, we should drive home together when your week is up. You should not have to fly home. We should all drive home together. ' And I was like, 'Oh no,' that's the worst thing I could hear because, you see, I'm so grateful that flying gets us there in a few hours, but driving takes days on end. And it's like boring when it's just the three of us. And somehow they made it out to be more of a hassle to fly than to drive, so I dreamt that we were going to lose some morning because we did not use our tickets, and we were going to have to drive home. And then I woke up, fortunately. Let's see, I'm trying to remember.\n",
      "0000000000000\n",
      "332 I'm back from my trip, but I dreamt that I was still on my trip. First of all, the weirdest part, I dreamt that Elizabeth had this car that had this alarm thing that she did not know how to shut off, or else she could not turn off unless she was going something like 50 or 60 miles an hour, so I think I was in Mr. Johnson's PE locker room again. I keep having dreams about stuff like back at my high school, and I do not understand it. So I was in Mr. Johnson's locker room waiting for Elizabeth to pick me up, but yet I'm still on my trip. I do not understand this notion. And there was like this indoor race track thing that Elizabeth was going to drive by and kick me up and go. And the thing of it was, she had to go as fast as she could and I had to jump in as fast as I could so that we could get to the 50 or so miles an hour she needed to shut the alarm off. That sounds like a movie to me. And so I'm waiting there and I do not really remember her ever, I heard the car with the alarm going on because she had to slow down a little to get into the race track thing, and I like grabbed onto the door and like jumped in and slammed the door and we raced off. And I think we were going kind of slow, but she finally got the alarm to shut off. I could not move around or anything. And then I dreamt that I was back in that locker room, and I had these pants, of all things, these pants that had an alarm on them. And how it would get activated is if you would touch the end of the belt strap to the belt buckle, that would complete some kind of circuit and it would not go off until you had the belt actually buckled. That was weird! Then I cannot remember  oh, I was at either Christine's house or Larry's house  I cannot remember which house. And we had all these aunties visiting us. And Dad was supposed to ride up on his bike any minute, I think, and come join the visiting party. And for whatever reason, I had a portable two. way radio, not in my pocket but literally stuffed down into my pants. I do not know why, but I did not have to be actually keying the transmitter. There was this Auntie Lovely, Mom called her, who had another one, and supposedly was listening in on everything we were saying, and I did not actually have to be keying the transmitter to let her hear what was going on; it just transmitted by itself. And then, when we were sitting there visiting, Uncle Larry was setting up the boom box and just as he was setting it up, this Auntie Lovely lady is talking to me through the unit, and it's real, real loud, and she's saying that she's almost there and she's going to be here real soon, and not to cut the cake without her or something. And I was thinking, 'Oh gosh, how embarrassing. ' And I was hoping that they could not tell it was actually me. I was hoping that they could just feel that the sound was like in the air or something. So I figure, 'I have got to do something. ' So I came in and I went into the bathroom, and I was going to like turn the volume down or turn that thing off or something, but then I kind of drifted into another scene. And this scene was that Mom and I had our car to drive up in my relative's home town and I had made a CD of the blue Wee Sing tape with the 'Blue Bird' song and everything on it. And for whatever reason, I had heard it three times earlier in the week and I wanted to play it again while we were driving around town. And so we did, and we were playing 'London Bridges' and 'Blue Bird' and all those other things while we were driving through town. And it was not scary or anything. It was just that there were other relatives in the car and I did not want them thinking that I was a baby by wanting to play that. And I think shortly thereafter I faded into consciousness. Oh no, I did not. There was more to it. Oh my gosh, this goes on and on and on. I'm going to use up this tape. I dreamt that after driving all around and stuff, going home to my home state was just like a bicycle ride away, and so Mom and I were going to just ride the thing home. And we sat out there talking to Christine for another hour as if we really did not want to go home, but we knew we had to. And it was like 1100 o'clock at night and we were still talking. And she gave us a blanket and a sheet and a little portable boom box machine that was actually like a kids' thing that was shaped like a bunny rabbit. And Mom stuffed it in her bicycle basket and then we started bicycling home in the night. And that's  oh, and I did not wake up yet. I dreamt that we got home and I was squished between Mom and Mrs. Dougherty on our porch swing, and we were telling her about her trip and some of the things that happened. And that's when I woke up finally. Oh, that was just so weird. I mean, I cannot even begin to sort it out. I mean, I think, they always say that the subconscious is nowhere near as bridled as the conscious mind. I think my conscious mind is severely ridiculing my subconscious for coming up with such weird whacko ideas. But, you know, there must be a factor going on in me somewhere that I need to pay attention to, I mean, as bizarre it may be. One other thing, I do not remember too much about the dream I was having last night, not last night but the night before when I slept downstairs on the air mattress, but I do remember, you know that thing that Mr. Romane taught us in 4th grade? It goes, 'Fuzzy Wuzzy was a bear, Fuzzy Wuzzy had no hair, Fuzzy Wuzzy was not fuzzy, was he?' That was a little song that he taught us, and he wanted us to move our hands up and down according to the intervals of the notes, and that, for whatever reason, kind of scared me  not in the dream, but in the class that he taught it to us did. And moving my hands up and down according to the notes made it feel worse because I could not put my hands how I normally put them when something scares me like that. And in my dream a couple nights ago I dreamt that I was in a public bathroom and they were playing that over the intercom, and it was not too much of a thing, but it was a little thing. And so I think half awake and half asleep, I turned over the way that I do. But I got the worst back ache and I realized that on that mattress it's not good for me to lay like that. That was crazy!\n",

      "Last night I had a very odd dream that there was this huge concert on the quad. There was a stage, a crowd, and everything. It was right in the beginning of the year, so everyone was really excited and energetic. I was sitting next to Gianna and we got called up on stage. When we got there, it started to shake uncontrollably, like some kind of trampoline. Everyone was laughing and cheering as we struggled to stay upright. We finally got off and walked inside Langton so I could go to the bathroom. I saw Lou and Ariana washing dishes. They had just seen my performance and were being really critical of it. Ariana said that when she saw me, she wanted to vomit. Lou laughed and then . to my horror . agreed. He was going out with Vanessa, and Ariana was discussing that now with Lou. I ran to the other end of the dorm and began to cry. I hated him for agreeing with Ariana, and I hated myself for liking him. On the opposite end of the hall was a movie theater. I went inside to watch Finding Nemo. There was a guy with flowers waiting for me; he was oddly reminiscent of Anthony. We began to chat and laugh, and soon Lou was out of my mind. When the movie was over, we walked out of Langton to find the campus deserted. We entered another dorm to find lots of people crammed inside. All the students were doing ridiculous chores and exercises as punishment from the teachers for having the huge concert. We ran out and into another dorm to avoid being caught and made to mow the grass with our teeth, or duel each other with umbrellas. We ran upstairs to my room. We could hear a teacher frantically pursuing us. I had the topmost loft as my room, only accessible by a leader, which unfortunately had been shattered. We tried in vain to climb up, but it was useless. We were caught and led downstairs where we were forced to drive metal pegs into the ground. Then I woke up.\n",

      "338 I'm not sure how much tape I have left, so I guess I'll have to be prepared to stop when I hear the thing coming to the end, and then start my sentence over again when it auto. reverses. Anyway, I had a kind of a blah dream last night. I dreamt that, for whatever reason, Dad had this mission to do somewhere up in the middle of the state. I think it was a medical thing. And he was going to leave  I think it was Thursday  and he was going to leave in the middle of the night and he was going to be gone Friday, Saturday and Sunday and he was going to be coming home sometime on Monday night. And while he was gone Mom and I and everybody  it was kind of understood that Mom and I were going to go up to my tech school by ourselves and have a tour there. And get this  Sheryl, Sandra and Sam were going to meet us there. And we were all going to come home and have a big house party at home. And I think they were going to hang around for the week, but I cannot remember. They might have been going to be gone by the time we got home, I cannot remember. But it was some party that we were really looking forward to. And so I think it was that he left in the middle of the night, and then it was the next day, and early Friday morning he was home. And for some reason, I cannot remember why, the trip for us to my tech school was off, and we communicated to Sheryl, Sandra and Sam that they should come meet us down in my home town instead. And they were not supposed to get here until Saturday afternoon. Well, you know, Dad has to be thinking about every single thing. He was starting to do a lot of that around the house, and I was thinking, 'Why the heck are you home so soon anyway?' And I could not wait for Sheryl, Sandra and Sam to get here, but I woke up before they did. And also in this dream, again before any of this happened, I dreamt that we were watching this spoof on the Mermaid movie, and there was this part to it that I never saw before. It was like telling some of the historical aspects of some of the characters that I never knew, like I guess some of Eric's friends. And Eric's friends were Arabic, and I dreamt that Eric was Arabic like Aladdin is. I guess the media is taking over. And I guess the movie showed the history of it. Wait, I think it's going to flip. No, it's not, I've got a ways yet. Anyway, it showed the history of Eric's background, which I'd never seen before, and I think there was one brief scene in the movie where King Triton was eating French soup or spaghetti or something. That was odd! Now I know there was something else to this, but I cannot remember what it was. Oh, I know, during all the nit. picking and stuff, I was on the phone with Jane, and she had a lower voice, and she had matured a little more, and she talked about things that were more diversified and she was a little more pleasant to talk to. And I guess that's that. I guess it came from the fact that Mom and Dad are going to take this defensive driving course to kind of lower their insurance rates, and it's four hours each day on two days, and it was on a Monday and a Tuesday, are the two days that they're going. And, you know, I get a  for them Tuesday and Thursday, so, of course, I wish they'd go on a Monday and Wednesday, but it's not given on Wednesdays. Oh well.\n",

      "346 I had kind of an interesting dream last night because it was like very vivid. I dreamt that we were going camping with Gary and Polly on a Sunday up to, I think it was something like Goldhead State Park, or something like that. And Astrid, when the dream took place, it was like a Wednesday, it was like a few days before camping, Astrid was over and, well, I think even before Astrid got there, Dad was being a little crabby like he gets some times, and Astrid shows up and then Gary and Polly show up. And I'm thinking, 'Oh good, we might be able to go a little early,' and, of course, a lot of people to be with, so things will be under control. And I think Gary and Polly came into my bedroom and I was like half naked, and I got a top and I put on a top, and I had to go pee and do a bunch of other things. And little did I know, but Astrid was sitting around bored most of that time. And I came into the living room and she was telling Gary and Polly, 'Twice now this has happened. She asked me over and got totally distracted,' something like that. And I came and sat down next to her. She was still talking as I was walking up because she did not now I was coming. And then I sat down and I took her hand and I talked to her to let her know I was there. And she moved her hand against my shoulder, which she's never done before in real life, and I was like, 'I'm sorry, I just had a lot of cleaning to do and stuff. ' And then when she was, a little while later, she leaned up and kind of kissed me on the cheek. And then, here comes the really bizarre part. I dreamt that this camping trip  well, not just for this camping trip  it had been done before, to have my whole system and everything piled into the back of the car, have the back seat taken out replaced with my desk and all my equipment. And I think I was counting on this setup for this trip because it was going to be quite a drive and I had some work to do for, I think for Dr. Moran, but I'm not sure who. And I cannot remember what in the world I was working on, but it was some kind of sequence. I kind of was thinking at that point that I would have access to the thing at school before I left , and I could do some of it there. And then suddenly in the course of all this, the scene shifted and I was at Dr. Moran's lab, except it was a huge room, and there were 40 or 50 work stations, kind of like in the commons on the second floor of the Business Tech Building that people were telling me about. Well, this place was like that except the work stations were like I'm used to working at. And somebody, like two or three work stations down from me, wanted to put a picture of Santa Claus on their desktop, and actually it was a picture of her uncle dressed as Santa Claus. And I heard somebody warning the person, like the Santa Claus picture that she had might have a virus in it, but nobody seemed to really concede. And then next thing I knew, everybody had Santa Clauses on their desktops because, I guess in that situation, it would be like a network and I guess what would happen to one would happen to all of them. But I had a Santa Claus on my desktop, but I wanted to get rid of it because I wanted the picture that I had before which I cannot remember what it was. I did not have a picture in real life, but in my dream I was used to having a picture of me in my home studio, I think. And so I wanted that picture back. And in the a process of trying to get rid of this Santa Claus and get my picture back, something happened, and I cannot remember if it was serious or not. But it was kind of in a fog and I faded into yet another scene, that I was at home and I was listening to like the American Idol on 94. 9, and it had somebody doing their version of Celine's 'On the Line' and it sounded darned close, but it was not. And then they were doing like other people's versions of other songs. I cannot remember exactly what they were. And then I woke up.\n",

      "351 Last night I had kind of a long dream, but it was not too, too long. I dreamt that we were going up to Be, my home state again, or somewhere up there, I was not exactly sure where it is, and we were going to stay at this rental like party house with, instead of Janice and Larry and Gary and Polly, we were going to stay with Sheryl, Sandra and Sam and Christine and Bill and Josie and Bobby. And there were about two or three bedrooms on the bottom floor, like two bedrooms on the top floor, and one bedroom at the very tippy top of the third floor. And mine was up on the third floor. Mine was the top one because I had like a lot of sound equipment that I was bringing in for their party, and, come to think of it, it would not make sense to put me and my equipment on the third floor. It would make sense to put us on the ground floor! But in my dream I was on the third floor and this place had an elevator, so I guess I could get it down alright. And to get there I think Mom and Dad preceded me because I had one more day of classes or something. And so I was on this bus, and I had two Peavey Escort systems for some crazy reason, I had a bunch of other stuff, but I was not sure exactly what. And I never actually had it in my hands. I had a few people helping me get it on the bus and into this cargo bay, and then when I got there, I do not remember getting there; I just remember suddenly being there. And I do not remember too much about the party we were having, but I do remember staying there, and I sort of remember something about us being together for like a little party or something, and it was outside on the deck. I had the Peavey system out there with the wireless mic. And then we kind of all went to sleep. I had the notion that the party was on the last night that we were going to be there, so after the party I did not take the Peavey system down and bring it back to my room or anything, I just left it set up. And we all kind of went to sleep. And I remember that night I did not go up to my room on the third floor with some other equipment piled into my room. That night I just went to  and I crashed in Sheryl, Sandra and Sam's room with them. And the next morning  you know how Dad likes to leave out of the house like 400 o'clock in the morning if we've got to drive across the state so we can get home at like a reasonable hour? Well, that's what we did, and, of course, I do not have any brains at that hour and then I think we were in the car and halfway through coming home, I realized I forgot both of the Peavey systems and all my other equipment. I left it there. And it was really a bad thing because Halloween was right around the corner. And we called Uncle Bob on the cell phone and he said, 'No problem, we'll swing by that way on the next step on our trip. We'll bring it and drop it off for you. ' And we said, 'Okay, that would be great. ' And, let's see, oh, when we got home, Uncle Bob had sent a new bag of Halloween things for me, like some plastic rats and some spiders and two statues  no, three or four statues of cats coming out of pumpkins and ghosts and various things and like lab ? statues that were like about as tall as my figures now. And there was a statue of Sir Mix. a. Lot, and at the base of the figure it said, 'Baby Got Back. ' And, of course, Mom was complaining. Oh, and there was one other thing he gave me. It was like a head, a pilgrim head on a stick with a stand. And Mom was really upset because she did not want to store all this new Halloween stuff. And she was like totally spoiling it for me. And all this stuff was meant to be a thank you for DJ'ing their party or something like that. And then I began to fade into consciousness and I was still kind of out there, but I realized that my Peavey system is on the porch. I just handled it last night, but I was wondering if I had left the wireless mic and other stuff over there. And then when I really came to, I realized that I only have one and it's all in my closet and that was just a dream.\n",

      "355 Last night I had a dream, but I do not know if it's all that important. It was kind of funny, though, but kind of boring in a sense. I dreamt that we were supposed to meet Grandma and Grandpa at this little restaurant, kind of like the days when we used to meet them at Ruby's all the time. Then it got to where we would drive over to Ruby's, then it got to the point they did not really want to go out that much any more. But it used to be we would meet them at Ruby's. Well, I dreamt that we were doing something like that, except it was like this little restaurant like Chucky Cheese, and there was this set of tables that had reserved that the waitress brought us to that had  what should I say  this little circle of, it was like a choo choo train merry. go. around thing and had these seats that people sat in that represented little animals, like there was a  they did not really look like the animals to the sight that I had, but I sort of had the notion and the waitress told me that they were animals. One was supposed to be a sheep, one was supposed to be a lion, and I cannot remember what the others were. And they called it the Ziggety Zoo suite or something stupid like that. And, let's see, I think I started riding in the sheep one, even though it was just sort of like a rocking chair with twirly whirls on the back, and it would go round and round and round and tipsing and over and upside down, and it dumped me out and I fell on the floor. And I think about that time Grandma and Grandpa came into the restaurant and my eyes were like closed. I could see darkness, I was coming into stage 1 sleep, but I sort of felt like they had the notion that I had fallen and I could not get up. And I was laughing hysterically still in my dream. And Mom was like, 'She's asleep, she's asleep,' on the floor there, and then I just kind of woke up.\n",

      "So first I dreamed that I was at my high school and it was the last day of this year. All these guys were asking me out. Then I was at college in California. It was the kind of college where if you went to my high school, you immediately went to this college. Then there were other kids from other schools there as well. It was really dangerous. We had to cross 6 roads all next to each other to get to the school. The last 2 were these horribly steep and narrow staircases where people would skateboard. I was walking down them and the skateboarders could not see us. So I was especially scared. I finally got to my dorm and all my friends were going skating. They all left and I changed and put sunscreen on. Andrea and Camilia were there and they wanted to know if my boyfriends at my high school had made me any more comfortable with dating in college. I guess I kind of blew them off, because next thing I know, I am at the beach. It started to rain, so I had to go back to school. I was so sad when I looked at all these pictures of my high school friends and realized how much I missed them. I was in English with a lot of the freshmen, and Ms. Williams came in and announced we were having the school play that day. Everyone was really excited, except me, because it was a Tuesday, and Tuesdays were my best days, so I would have to miss my favorite classes. We had 30 minutes before we had to be in the auditorium. I went looking for my friends. Sue was giving a tour. Gianna and her brother were up in the math wing. I started walking to the dining hall. Gabby was in the senior quad and she started making fun of me because I always looked shy. Beside her was a shelf of books. They were all fictional love stories. Then I woke up.\n",

      "372 I think I had a dream about walking into outer space last time, but I'm not really for certain. I'm not sure if it was a real plane or a Disneyland ride, but it was something that I was flying in, like some kind of tour or something. And we were like shooting up, you know how that goes. And there was like this tour guide that was talking and saying something about how we go up into the atmosphere and we're in this dark realm where we can see the planets and things, and then we go up further and we actually escape the earth's gravitational force. And it's like, this does not make sense, man, if you can see the earth and you're out of its gravitational force, but I guess it's the orbit that I'm thinking of. We could be in orbit and see the planet, but still be in its gravity and then shoot way far out in the middle of nowhere and then be out of orbit and just spinning free. So that was a messed up dream with nothing to it, I guess.\n",

      "I dreamed that I owned this salty bar with Granddaddy right next to the ocean. One day, the whole school had to sail over to China to hear some sort of lecture. I missed the boat and had to swim over. I had brought a plate of Brie, but it was filled with poisonous crabs from my trip over. I dropped the dish when I got on land, and was terrified that they would poison me. But then I told myself that this was a dream, so I kept on walking to the lecture. When I got there, it was more like SNL than a serious lecture. I could not understand why we'd had to travel that whole way for this. I was sitting on the stage and could see Jackson right in front of me. The lecture ended 3 hours early. The deans said we had to remain there for the next 3 hours before going back. Vanessa started whining but then everyone made fun of her, so that was OK. Then Jackson looked at me and said he loved me and I woke up.\n",

      "396 But after that scene I was at my tech school, which really I started off being at my college and I sort of found myself there at my tech school, and it was a real maze. I came in with Mom and Dad, sort of like at the top of a little hallway, and down to one side was an auditorium, a big auditorium, where you know how the seats go, they went down. And to the other side was steps down into the lobby of the building, and all of this was real colorful like their brochures are. It was like in that brown and black and orange mainly, like their brochure pictures are. And to the left there was lots of little treats and stuff that they set out for people coming in, like little glasses with jello and stuff, and little dessert dishes and ice cream and brownies and stuff. And to the right was lots of stuff, lots of other facilities. And Mom and Dad kind of trailed behind me and let me run along ahead, and it was like a real maze. By the way, I did not taste any of the treats; I do not know why. And I went around to this other stairwell that led back up, and I wanted to see what was up there because I  oh, before that  this is kind of crazy. For some reason I had this set of cans that I picked up from the floor, and when I got to the bottom of the stairwell I turned around and there was these people standing by this little six. channel mixer up on the wall, they were controlling the sound system of the house. And I gave the set to them, and they said, 'Oh thanks, they belong here. ' And then I turned around and I went up this other stairwell and Mom and Dad were like behind me, but they were a few feet behind me. And I met up with this other, I had the notion like he was a sound engineer, but he was kind of giving us a tour, and he took me up this stairwell that turned into like a ladder to his little recording booth. And there was this opening that was like really, really small, and he said, 'Nobody can get in here like this. ' He gave me his, like a ticket thing. I slid it in the slot and the whole ladder moved down and the whole thing opened up so that it was then the opening was about from my chest to my head, so then a person could crawl in. But the recording booth was still so small. I do not know how anybody could sit in there and work comfortably. And I was feeling really claustrophobic at this point because not only was I going to have to go in the small recording booth, but I was going to have to go in the, it was just real tight all around. And then he took us down and outside, and kind of around the back of the building, and we were like in a straw barn and we were sitting on benches kind of outside the straw barn, with hay all around and stuff. And there was a reinforcement system out there in the straw barn, and some guy turned it on and walked away. And for some reason I was so bold, I went up and I sat down at the mixer bench area, and the mixer board was green, kind of like an integrated circuit board, but it had all the stuff right on it, and it was flat. I found the two left and right CD faders and I brought them up, and I tweaked some EQ and stuff, and I was watching the videos ? and finally I brought up my master a little. And I went back to my seat and then I woke up.\n",

And they had brought in this professional test proctor and this test proctor had all the people sitting in black across part of the length of the room, just sitting on stools and taking this test. And I was at a regular desk in the back of the room, and Mom was there, and when I got my book she was going to go outside with me so we could read it, and the teacher directed me to do that. That's what me and Elizabeth used to do. And when we got outside there were these big bumps in front of the building that I almost tripped over, and that I was crawling over so I could really feel how they were going. And then we got to a picnic table where we were going to take the test, and Mom was bringing out food and drinks and picnic stuff and we're picnicking and talking about everything under the sun, except doing the test. And I'm telling her, 'Come on, come on, I gotta take this test. I do not know when the period's going to end, but I have to take the test. ' But she said, 'You have extra time; do not worry. ' And I think that was that, and then I woke up. But before any of this, before I went into my test room, I dreamt that Mrs. Dougherty was in the hall talking to somebody, and she was going to drive up in a fire truck with a whole bunch of costumes. And she was going to whoop the siren really loud so everybody would know she was there with them.\n",

      "I am listening to a woman speak. She is telling the story of her giving birth. She describes how she was at home, she started to give birth, she called her doctor, the doctor was not that helpful I think the doctor was a man, the baby came out, as she felt the baby exit her body she sensed that this was a moment of sundering, she felt pain at the separation, at the awareness, still subliminal, that her daughter would never again be inside her body, one with her, but rather would be separate, outside her body, out in the world. As the woman is describing this, I can see it all, clearly and vividly, and can sense it, as if the woman is me, as if she is telling my story, as if this was my own memory. I can see the birth and sense how the woman felt. She goes on to say that she gave birth herself, and, as she describes it, while standing up, I think, standing up at home, with no attendant or doctor or even nurse, but still, the baby comes out, then, she describes how, after the baby is born, her husband comes out and helps to take care of the baby he was in another room by wrapping the baby in a towel and giving the baby a bath, bathing the baby, and that is his way of connecting with the baby. As she tells it, their ways of bonding were differentshe, the mother, was fundamentally connected with the baby by virtue of having had her inside her body and given birth to her, and her husband was connecting with the baby after the birth, through bathing her and wrapping her in a soft white towel. As the woman tells the story of her daughter's birth, I have this sense that the force that compelled the daughterbaby to be born, even in the absence of a doctor or attendant, was the force of life itself, the energy and rush and forward movement and insistence of life itself, 'this is the way life insists on itself', the pushthrust forward into the great unknown, the drive toward birth, toward bursting out of shells, toward emerging, toward unfoldingbut not in a casual, gradual unfolding though that may have happened earlier, during gestation, but a bursting forth from oblivion into the world, from darkness into light, to hatch, to emerge, to burst forth, compulsion, energy, the force of life, the compulsion of life, the need for life to continue itself, life's need to produce life, to beget life, to create life, to create itself anew, life's own need for renewal, to renew itself, life's need to renew itself, which never ceases, the phenomenon of renewal, which never ceases, 'to trust in that daring that shapes the world.

The first thing I can remember is that some relatives were in town, and I think it was Arlene and Larry and Jack and Polly, and it was Christmas time. And we were doing something downtown and I think Sheryl, Sandra and Sam were there, in addition to these other people. And we were going around downtown and doing stuff, and there was some kind of exhibit show in the Coliseum and we were walking around. And then there was supposed to be a Celine Dion concert like the Las Vegas show, and apparently because it was not making too much money up there, it had to tour and it had to come down and go to another place. And so I was thinking, 'Oh, man, we do not even have to pay 80 bucks to get it; we're already in. ' And Mom's like, 'Well, I do not know, we've got people to go do stuff with and we do not know what they're doing and what their plans are' and stuff. And so we went outside and we started walking down the road and then I found out that Mom and Dad had bought two tickets for the concert for Christmas for me, and so we went back in, and Mom kept stalling and stalling doing different things, and finally we got in and we got to our seats. And this heavy metal guitar person opened for her, and then when it was her turn to come out and take the stage, they pulled down a movie screen and I found out it was not going to be a concert. They were going to show a horror movie that she starred in. And I was like, 'What!?'\n",

Well, first of all I dreamt that I was back at my high school, kind of at like a summer school camp thing, and the transition students from the Wilcox Center were all there at this camp thing. I do not know why I keep having dreams about being back at my high school. I just do not get it! We were like doing a like a tour or some kind of a PE thing, and there was like this courtyard thing that we were all one. And we were like walking around the school and then coming back to the courtyard. The fire alarm system went off while we were out there, and, of course, it was not too terrible because we were out in the middle of a big space between a bunch of the buildings and things. And we were already out, so there was no reason to go running in either. I do not remember it was, whether it was just sort of a fluke or what. All the buildings it had shut off in except for the gym. The PE teacher was Alisha Wolf and she was going to take us in that gym no matter what. Yeah, it was still sounding in the gym, but she was going to take us in there anyway. And we were lining up getting ready to go in there. And you know how at my high school the Media Building and everything over in that area was like twice as bad as the other buildings. Well, the gym was like that too. And I was getting ready to skip class and run off somewhere, so I would have done anything except going into that gym while that alarm was sounding. And I could not believe that the PE person was going to take us in there anyway. But as we were going in there, it just seemed to get quieter and quieter and just sort of not be a thing any more. And it must've just been outside or something like that. And then we were doing our thing, we were playing ball or something, I do not remember. And then one of the girls in the transition program told me that she thought that Dad was having an affair with Charlene Oliver because she saw these pictures of them together on the internet. And that all the details about how she was attracted to him because he made her feel so special and how now she wanted to be called Eva or Gigi, and that Charlene was just sort of a middle name. And that was such a surprise! And I think there was one other person involved in this, but I cannot remember who. And then all of a sudden I was here in my house and I found this CD on the desk that like had some pictures and stuff on it. So I brought it up here and put it in my machine up here and tried to open it up, and it started acting like the Windows operating system, like the usual thing that you get, and to close in the upper right and all like that. And when I finally got to open the main part, it was like some kind of game thing. It was all these different pictures, and I was trying to copy and paste that one picture of him with Charlene Oliver onto like a blank document, and I could not because it was in this game thing. And I was trying to open up the list of jpegs to that I could just grab that one, and I woke up before I could get there.\n",

      "448 These are two dreams that I had while I was staying up at the springs, but I did not have this tape with me so I could not remember them then, so I'm recording them now. The first night I dreamt, I had kind of a screwy dream about a fire truck again. I keep having dreams on and off about fire trucks with the scary back. up alarm sound, and it's got to be kind of a dream symbol and I've got to figure out what it means. But anyway, I dreamt that I was going to help out the fire station with some kind of carnival or something. I do not remember having to deal with the Peavey system, but I was running around like putting tables up and stuff, and I had my cell phone on. The thing of it was, whenever anybody would call me on the cell phone, instead of answering the phone, I had to jump on the, you know, like hold onto the side of one of the trucks and let them drive off on a call with me. And we did not only go on a call, we just sort of went around the block and came back. That was kind of stupid! But I had a partner who was going to drive, like a man, like you know how they do. And Dad was there and I had a feeling he was like directing the events. He was not really going on any calls, but he was like an active lieutenant for the day. And when we'd jump on the side of the truck, the truck had two vacuum cleaner hose like type things hanging off the back of it dragging in the street. And you know how back. up alarm goes 'Doo doo, doo doo,' well, the one hose would make the high 'Doo' sound and the other hose would make the 'doo. ' lower pitch And now that I think about it, it's the funniest thing. It would be going down the road like that. And it would do that sound when we were going forward, and we would not back up, we'd just go forward and it would make that sound. And I know there was something more. Oh, in my dream it kind of scared me and I was dreading, dreading, dreading having to go on that. And so whenever I would get a call on my cell phone, I would think, 'Oh no, oh no, I've got to go do this. ' And that was that.\n",

I thought it was ok to leave the dorm after check. in since I was trying to help someone else. Mrs. Crank was prowling Taylor and caught me hiding under Pete's bed. Although I thought it was OK, I still felt like I was doing something wrong. So then I was sent home for breaking check. in, and my father got really mad at me and lecture me in front of the whole boys' varsity hockey team. I was really embarrassed. Then I was at the refuge in the mountains with him and the boys' hockey team. A bus stopped and Lou got out. His footsteps made so much noise because he had gotten fat over the summer. Then my father was reading an updated version of The Great Gatsby, which was actually about Lou and me, and everything worked out in the end, and no one died. My favorite passage about their first kiss and the tuning fork in the real book, had been rewritten about LOU giving me this look and me crying because he was convinced that he did not like me. But then we got together in the end. That night I had to clean up the refuge for dinner. I began sweeping and mopping and Sophia got mad at me because she thought she had cleaned earlier, and that I was only cleaning because I thought she had done a bad job. So she got really pissed off. That night there was a big winter carnival with all sorts of sports games going on. Caroline wanted me to come watch her swim meet, but I wanted to watch the boys' hockey game. I went and remembered seeing Lou skate out onto the ice. I guess I started a new dream, because I was all of a sudden drafted for some war against England. My canon was stuck and I was so terrified. Then I got shot in the leg. I somehow ran to a boat collecting people, and Lou was there too for Christ's sake. We ended up in the Bermuda Triangle, where we got lost. The compass pointed north no matter we turned, so we had no idea how to get anywhere. We ended up pretending we were Peter Pan and Captain Hook fighting, and then I woke up.\n",

      "465 Last night I was having a dream that I was going with ten other people from my high school, and Elizabeth and Mom and two other people, to Disneyland. And I cannot remember why, but, oh, because we only had ten people and four chaperones and it was not big enough to take the bus. And Mom was going to drive some people in our car. There was one other person driving that I did not know, and Mom had me ride in Elizabeth's Mustang with her and two other people. And so we started out and she was driving and she had this teensy little unit in the front of her car, and, you know, she used to have, or in real life she probably still does have this booming sound system. So I do not know what was up with that dinky little, actually it was like a dinky little portable boom box that she just put in the front of her car. And we got to someplace to eat, and we stopped and we kind of diddled around; we did not really eat. And then we kept going and we got to like an outside part of the park where we were going to just stop for a while and collect our sits, because we started out at 600 or so and it was late at night now. I cannot remember if it was early in the morning or late at night, but we stopped there to kind of collect our wits. And we were all kind of assembling together and I, Mom gave me my mini disc recorder out of her bag, and she wanted me to put it on my person so that I would have it if I needed it. But I reminded her that to go into the park, we'd have to go through a metal detector and they might find it and they might think it was really weird. And she said, 'You're going to have to get used to this, blah, blah, blah,' so I put it in my pocket and it had this long RCA to 18' ? adaptor on it and I kept trying to shove that in my pocket too, and it kept hanging out, which I do not know why I would need that if I'm not connecting it to my sound system here at home. And I cannot remember if I kept it or I gave it back to her, but then, next thing I know, two of the kids from my high school are kind of shoving me into this shallow pool of water that only comes up to the middle of my calfs. And we walk around and this thing's got like a soft bottom like South Bend pool, but I wanted to get out real fast because I heard there were prickly things and grates and other things in it. And, you know, the whole point of the dream was that we diddled and we diddled and we diddled and we diddled and we diddled the day away, and we never got to go on any, go see any stuff in Disneyland. We just diddled. And I even, I rode home with Mom in her car, in our car, but we got home at like real late at night, and I was wanting to say, 'Let's go back; let's go back there and do some stuff on our own. ' And she was like, 'Yah, do, do, do, do. ' And then I woke up.\n",

      "466 Last night I had a horrible dream. I dreamt that Sheryl and Sandra and Sam and Jason were all in town, and Lee was there too. And I dreamt that there was sort of a new wave type of thing that the family was getting into, and it seemed like when any of them were together the only thing they could ever discuss and debate was how people should live if they are considered to be true Christians. And they would argue and debate over things, and one of the claims that one of them made was that you're never supposed to eat sheep meat, no matter what, that sheep are like the holiest symbol and you're never supposed to eat them. And it really is not right to keep them in captivity, but a lot of people do. And I dreamt that there was this one lady that they talked about who would, you really were not supposed to eat cat meat either, but she would like cut into the leg of her cat and take a little bit of meat off of him, and sew up the cut. Talk about gross! And the animal would live and she would not want the neighbors to know that she was eating the meat of her cat, but she was, and the animal was still alive so it was not really obvious. And after all of that, I faded into another little scene that we were at a dock, at a boating ramp dock thing, and Dad was getting training through the Fire Department, along with some other guys, in how to drive these dinky little boats that would go fast one way and then would go really fast the other way in reverse. And I guess they were supposed to be used to look for people and stuff, but this boat was small enough that an adult person could lay down in the bottom of it and they would be touching either end of it with their head and their feet, almost a little bigger than a bathtub. So Mom and Dad were lounging back in the seat of this thing and they were going to start up the motor and start running around, and they got me in between them on board and it was sort of floating away from the dock, and they were going to start up the motor and start running it around and stuff. And I asked, 'Well, was it going to be as loud as the one we used to have?' And they were like, 'Yeah. ' So I sort of jumped out of the boat, which was really easy. All I had to do was just swing my legs over and I was in the water. And I swam back to the dock and I just laid on the dock and just let them drift away. And then I woke up.\n",

So she was in our car and we were taking her up to like . And then it kind of shifted to that I was going to do a second year at my college for some reason. And I had a music class with a woman that I went to, and she was having us go around the room and sight read out loud, you know, like you read out of any other book. And this room was like big and open and it had tables with all kinds of stuff that we sat at. And the floor was yellow, kind of like linoleum and let's see, she was having us paint these little rolls for some reason. I cannot tell you what that had to do with it, other than it was a sort of melding into being an art class. And when that class was over, Mom had my schedule and she was waiting outside for me. And I did not know what else I had to do in the day and I was kind of nervous because I knew I was just going to miss a class because that music class went over so long. And, let's see, oh, she read my schedule out loud to me, and I had that class first and then three personal fitness classes, and then something else. And I asked if she would take me around and show me where they all were, and she's like, 'Well, I really do not have time; can we do it another day?' And I said, 'Well, the least you could do is mark that paper for me. ' And she's like, 'Well, there's not a copy machine here, so let's go home and maybe we'll get over to the hardware store sometime. And then I woke up.\n",

      "497 And the second crazy dream I had was about a little while later, after I went pee, and in this dream I do not know how I was there, but I was with Mom and we were kind of at a backstage area of like a beauty contest, and these ladies were coming through all dressed up with their little helper kids. And they were getting presents and leaving them backstage in their areas and going on, filing on through. And they were stopping in this kitchen where we were, and one of our neighbors was there, and I think Mom and I were cooking food. And Aunt Christine had this  I felt like Aunt Christine was going to come through this beauty line, and she never did. And the next thing was that we were here in my bedroom and it was daylight, Mom pulls out a little portable radio from when the girls were here. It was like theirs. And she turns it on and it's like, she's just talking to it, 'I miss my relative's home town,' and stuff like that. That was weird. But then we were like walking, and we said, 'Let's walk to Jackson,' and I'm like, 'Okay,' and so we're 15 minutes around and we cross a little bridge diagonal like across some kind of water and we're in this nature park and area that she tells me is Bestin ?. And there's this man with his bird that got loose and almost runs in front of a car, but I was saying to her, 'If it only takes us 15 minutes to walk to Bestin, then why does it take us 3 hours or nearly 8 hours to drive there?' That was messed up, man!\n",

      "499 The day that's supposed to be my going away party, but just listen to the wind outside! The hurricane's going to make my party go flop. But anyway, I had a crazy dream last night. I dreamt that I was in my apartment and I was having some visitors over as an apartment. warming party, and it was really an odd type of a place, and as I was walking around through it, I was feeling like, 'This is not what I had in mind. I had a more normal place in mind. ' First of all you had to go up three steps and duck to get in the front door. It was almost like climbing in a window. And there was a couch right in front of it, so it was like a window instead of a front door. And then the bedroom had somebody else's stuffed animals in it, and it had kind of a small and bleah bed, and there was like a shelf mini sound system up on top, like in order to touch it, you had to stand on tippy toes on the bed, but you had a remote control that you could sit somewhere and control it with. And it sounded kind of old and kind of bleah, and you would press a certain button the remote control and it would act as a remote controller for the washing machine. And it had a little laundry chute where you would put the clothes, that was white, right next to the black sound array setup. And you'd put the clothes in and then you would use the sound system remote to control what the clothes have to do in the washing machine. How bizarre! How bizarre! And then Mom wanted to take me down to the cellar to see what the washing machine was doing, and I just did not want to go. I was scared to death to go in the cellar, and that's really all I can remember about that dream. And then I woke up because I thought somebody was knocking on my door, but it was the stupid window banging on the awning. The wind was blowing it around. I dreamt that we were at the park and Mom was playing one of my mixed CD's on her boom box, which it really does not sound that good, but it did in my dream, and I was sitting in a banyan tree. And then I came down and we were laying on a blanket and somehow Dad found one of my diary books and happened to open it up to kind of an innocuous passage about being in the park and climbing the tree, and he read it out loud, which I let because I knew there was nothing in that passage. And then he turned the page and he came to something about how hard to get along Arlene is and I made him close the book. And he was suggesting in my dream that he wanted me to scan these pages so that they would not be on paper any more. 'I do not understand,' he says, 'a person who does not think too much technology in somebody's life, gidgets and gadgets, is a good thing. ' But he's got this thing against having stuff on paper. I do not know what it is, but in my dream he was wanting me to scan those pages in my diary so they would not be on paper any more. And I told him, 'It does not do OCR for handwriting. It probably will someday, there'll probably be an update and then I will, but not now. It does not do OCR for handwriting. ' Well, he did not care; he wanted me to. So before I woke up, in my dream I was sitting there trying to do the thing, and I was getting a little tangled up and I was not sure where I was going and what I was doing. And then I woke up.\n",

      "508 The last three nights I've been having pretty dynamic dreams, but I just finished the whole blank tape and I have been reluctant to start another one. And mostly I've been writing them down in my journal, or rather typing them. But I feel like, for some reason or another, I need to go back to speaking on a tape. And I think that is because my writing  I describe things differently when I write than when I speak. And for journal and for diary that's good because I like my word sense per se, my syntax. I like how I can sit and come up with vivid descriptions of things. But in my dreams some things are very vivid, and I cannot describe them in words, and it's easier to describe them verbally than actually writing it down in words. Although sometimes it may be better to write them down in words because I capture more detail that way, like when I wrote about Sheryl and Sandra and Sam and I singing on stage and jumping on this trampoline, I just filled that with as many details as I could think of. And I guess I have to try to do that in my . And I keep saying one of these days I want to sample all these things and I want to turn them into mp3's and I want to cram tons of them on a single CD so that I do not have all these tapes laying around, and so that I can start using the tapes again to do stuff like this, because every time a thought rips me, I do not want to have to stop what I'm doing or get up in the middle of the night and go turn in my machine and grab a mike and plug it into the mixer and go to c and get Pro and doot, do doot, do doot; doot, do doot, do doot. I want to grab my take machine, hit 'record' and start saying what's on my mind or what I'm thinking before it just totally goes away. So it's better consistent, just voice, it does not really matter; it does not have that much spectrum to it. So I can use tapes to capture it and then sit around diddling, diddling and diddling and diddling after the fact. So here we go. Last night's dream is still the clearest to me because it was the most recent and because it kind of hit my like a ton of bricks in the way. Not that heavy, but it was something that I was thinking about. I dreamt I was back home in my home town and it was like I had been away for a while, like I am, and I was coming home. And they were having a celebration for me, but it was a little pinky celebration. There was like three people there, I think Clark and Marylou and Terri. And they were just talking, there was no real party going on. But somehow Mom was riding the bike and I was sitting on her handlebars in the basket, and she was telling me that she was pregnant, and that she was having a baby. And she said that she did not want to have to start all over again, but that Dad wanted another child, and he did want to start all over again. And so she had to have this baby because he wanted one. And she said, 'I'm only going to love this baby half as much as I love you. ' And I was so sad for her because, first of all, she did not want to start all over again. This is a time in her life where she's ready to move on and do other things, and apparently it was not like the regular pregnancy term. It was this deal where you get pregnant, and four or five days later the baby pops out. That was messed up, man. And then we were on  in the last scene of that dream  we were on the bed, and I was laying and I was talking to Mom about various things. And she was signaling to me that Dad was on the other side of the bed and not to say anything really outlandish. And I looked over and I saw that he was, but in this dream that was unusual because she was on his side of the bed and he was on her side of the bed. Now his side of the bed is the closest to the short mirror dresser and the stereo receiver in the room, and her bed is closer to the upright dresser and the night stand and the air conditioner thing. a. ma. jiggy. So in my dream they were kind of reversed, and I was just kind of making up small talk. And then I woke up. Now the night before I had a dream that was real, real kind of foggy and bleah and blurry, and literally I was walking around in a blurry world. But the concept and what happened is kind of not clear either. I dreamt that we had come home from some kind of long trip and we needed to do something with Grandpa, and it was dark out. And Dad was in the truck and Mom was in the car, and I was riding with Mom in the car. And Dad was going to go to Home Depot and get one or two things for Grandpa and then go over to his house. And Mom said she was going to go do some grocery shopping and make some copies and this and that and the other, and she said, 'I hope you do not mind me driving around so much. ' And Dad was like, 'No, that shows that you love me and you want to take care of things around the house, and for the house. And I was like, 'Wow,' they would never say anything like that in real life. They've never been gushy over each other. And so Mom and I really were just going gallivanting, just going to do all this stuff together, and we were in this area that had woods. We stopped the car and for some reason we shut off the engine, but the headlights were still on. And she was guiding me through this banyan tree area, I think there were like several banyan trees. And there was this net, and she led me through, you know, tripping through the roots and everything, and there was a butterfly caught in the net, and it was a big butterfly, about the size of my two hands put together, if each hand was a wing. And I looked like a Monarch, and it touched it, and that helped it get out of the net and it flew off. But I felt good that I was actually able to see a butterfly. And that's all I can really remember about that dream. And the third one that was two nights ago or three nights ago, I dreamt that I was at some kind of beach with Mom and Dad and Terri and a bunch of other people, and we were planning this celebration for me for some reason. I think had either graduated or had some kind of successful milestone and we were going to be in a parade, and we were going to be in a school bus in a parade. And we were organizing like the parade route and this and that and the other, and the bus driver had this really thick Spanish accent. And this lady  I do not know who she was  I do not know who she was, but she was very outgoing, she sounded like a cross between Terri and Serena Potter, and she was leading everybody and trying to get them to have fun and party on this bus. And you know how buses have intercom systems sometimes to talk to the passengers? Well, she was, her and another cluster of people were yelling into the mike, saying, 'Party, yahoo!' and stuff like that. And I'm really surprised that there was no feedback, but in this dream that law of physics was suspended, and it was funny because she aimed it at me and I was sitting like four rows back. And she said, 'Jasmine, say something!' And I do not remember what I said, but I said something and it was amplified as though I was talking into it. And that's all I can remember about that.\n",

      "509 Last night I dreamt that my tech school was having a seminar at the City Airport about audio related to the travel industry, so to speak, and what goes into like setting up the PA on a plane, and what goes into like wiring one of those airports for sound and stuff. And I just thought that was going to be so interesting, but how I was going to get from here to City Airport was beyond me. And actually in this dream I was back in my home town, and I actually had to do a triangle. I had to get back over to my tech school, then over to City Airport. Somehow Mrs. Dougherty was involved, and I wanted Mom to go with me so I wanted her to chaperone this field trip. And, you know, things are not organized like they used to be in high school, but I thought they were in this dream, and I thought we were going to have a really big bus that was going to just drive us, and Mom could sit on the bus and chaperone the trip, you know. But the only hitch here is that I could not find the papers that said what day that was going to be, and it was going to be on a Tuesday and in my dream I did not know if that was going to be today or next week. And so I was afraid that I missed it. And actually when I was trying to tell Mom and Dad about this, Mom was drawing something, and Dad suggested putting serial numbers on the back of her painting so that if she did two or three of similar, then it would kind of add value to them. And I could tell it went over like a lead balloon with Mom. But she said, 'Okay, that's a good idea. ' And she was going upstairs to her room to look for the papers, and then I woke up.\n",

      "517 Last night I dreamt that there were people that lived in our complex that were having a wedding, and they invited Jill and I. In my dream we were close to water, and at these peoples' place they had this house and they had this pool and then in the back they had a boat, but it was more like a big, big ship. This place was close enough that I could walk from my apartment. And so Jill and I walked over and once we got there, we kind of like parted ways, like we would not be together. And I walked around and I looked at things. I walked around the pool and I was careful not to fall in because it was actually kind of cold, but I went in these scruffy. looking shorts and this pink sweater with gold sleeves. It was still kind of tame; people were getting ready, but the bride had not changed yet. She was still in like beach clothes, and I did not even know who she was. I did not know why anybody was. And, but they were real warm and friendly. They seemed to know me real well. I think a girl and her father and the son were kind of milling around. Nobody had already changed yet. They did a little bit of stuff and I was thinking how, man, it would have been so nice if I could have the Peavey system and DJ for them. I was thinking how I could not have gotten it from my home town to here and here to there in an hour, so that was kind of a lost cause. After a while, when everybody went to change, I went back to my apartment to change into shorts, and I did not know what happened to Jill. She must have went off with some other people or something. And I put long pants on and kept my pink sweater with the gold sleeves. At that time I think they were like starting to serve some food and I got a little bit, and then they were going to take everybody on the ship for the actual party. They did not actually do any exchanging of vows or anything. They just had like a reception party, and everybody was changed into their clothes and everybody was all authentic and everything, and we were on this big ship. It reminded me of the Prince Eric ship. And I went out on  it was not tall like the Titanic, but it sure was long  and I went out on the deck and I sat out there to look out on the water. In my dream I feel asleep, and I fell asleep while all the partying was going on. Whoever was captaining the ship came to get me to say that he had come back to dock and that it was time to go back to the house. And he was real nice and, you know, when I step on and off of a boat, I have to take somebody's hand, and he gave me both hands like I need and he kind of helped me get on dry land. And then when I went into the house, Mom was there, and she was helping them pick up the food and clean up everything, and I did not get to have any wedding cake because I was asleep, and so she gave me some. And there was this milk bottle thing that I felt was going to have milk in it and so I poured some in a cup and I was going to have cake and milk, but instead what it was, was some kind of cleaning stuff and I took a sip and I was like, 'Bleah!' and it was a good thing I did not swallow. . Hey, that was perfect timing. Did you hear how that tape did not flip until I was done? I've never had good timing like that before. Let me just sure things happened when they were supposed to. And the night before I had a dream that I did not get a chance to put on the tape, that I will now. Kind of goofy. I dreamt that I was still in the middle of my program at my tech school, but it was Christmas again already. Mom and Dad and Sandra, and I think Sheryl and Sam, were coming to visit me. And my room was a little bigger than it actually was, and I had wooden floors in this place, and it was kind of dark. And I had the two  was plugged in, and I had the angels and swan thing on my dresser, like I do. We were all sitting around in here. There were not enough chairs so everybody was on the floor in the space in front of my bed, over by the computer table and the dresser, the big open area. We were all sitting around in a circle in that area. We were talking about how we were going to go from my place to my home town in a whole like caravan train and Mom and Dad were doing to drive their car and Sheryl and Sam were going to go in theirs and Sandra was going to go in hers, and we were going to just do a caravan train. And we were bringing a bunch of furniture and stuff with us, as though I were going to move back. Mom had brought me the cheap TV trays like she told me she was going to, but when we went back to my home town, she brought them back. And in my dream we were going to bring all my Christmas decorations and things, for what reason I do not know. And without my really knowing, Mom packed my keyboard in the stuff to go home. When we got home, she set it up on the kitchen table, with the tablecloth folded back, and she wanted me to play her a song while she was wrapping Christmas presents. And I kind of kept procrastinating and dawdling a little because I knew that everybody was outside and they were going to come in the back door and they were going to start parading through the kitchen any minute. And so, sure enough, they did and I told Mom, 'Come one, we've got to flip the tablecloth down. ' And so she flipped the tablecloth down and nobody saw anything and they paraded through the kitchen. In my dream they did not even have a Christmas tree up yet because something sad happened and she did not get to put it up. So I do not remember, I think we were going to do something like that.

Next I said good. bye to Mason, and he was sitting between Vanessa and Beth, both his girlfriends, so I apologized for embarrassing him in front of them. Then I said good. bye to Leo, Ida, Hazel, and Etta, and Wong, who tried to push me off the bleachers. Finally I said good. bye to Arthur, Bud, and Jayden. I looked on the ice and saw Lou, playing defense, and he accidentally let the puck by and spluttered, It. it was not my fault. I felt bad for him and thought, There's so much I want to say right now that cannot be said in a letter. Then, very sad, I looked at the rink one last time and left. At home, my father and I had to go get my brother from his hockey game. My father wanted me to drive to get used driving conditions. But before we left my computer malfunctioned and I had about 12 copies of every program on my desktop, which was really annoying. Then I woke up.\n",

Then we were at orientation in the music building, and I cannot remember anything else. Then I was living somewhere between New York and my high school. Harvey was playing in a concert and wanted me to tell him I loved him, but I just ignored him. Jennifer Anniston wanted to go on a date with my parents. Then last year's seniors were doing senior mauling, where they beat up all the underclassmen. Ian kept tickling me and we were laughing. Tyler saw us and got upset because Ian was talking to me.

We were in this house that was sort of a combination of your typical modern house, our house and my apartment, and our families were there. And Jill and I really got on each other's nerves, but our families seemed to not mind each other at all. The scene that I can remember is that I was in the bathtub washing up my feet and stuff, and I was totally naked, and Jill wanted to use the bathtub when I was done. And I asked her, 'Do you want me to let the water out of the tub and put new water in for you, or do you want to wash in the same water as me?' And she's like, 'Oh, Jasmine, nobody washes in any kind of water that anybody else washed in. ' So I figured, okay, so I let the water out and there were a whole bunch of people in the bathroom watching me. And I swished it down the drain with my feet, and Mom carried me, wrapped me in a towel, and she carried me right from the bathroom right out to her bike. And I was wrapped in a towel, and Dad had his bike. And Mom rode me in the basket of her bike, just like we used to, and they said, 'We've got a surprise for you. ' And I'm like, 'Well, you cannot take me anywhere if I'm not dressed. ' But we were riding down the street and we came to this place that was called Discovery Track. It really sounds familiar, but I'm not really sure if it's a real place or not. We got off the bike, and I was dragging some kind of a cart behind me for a minute, and we were walking along this narrow brick road thing, and everywhere we looked there were model classic cars. There was an old fire truck, a really old white pick. up truck, a couple of Corvettes, some black car with the booshy front, around in front, and there was a twin of our car, and there were two Cadillacs parked in a garage, and there was also like a, oh, I do not know, a spinning ride thing off in the corner. And I got the feeling that this whole thing was like an amusement park ride, where you would sit in one of these old cars and somebody else would drive it or it would drive itself kind of around and around and around this race track. And you'd get a little ride and you'd say, 'Oh whoopee, I rode in an old car,' and then you'd get out. Look, I had a feeling there was going to be something more to it for me because I was special, and so they were taking me off to see this little movie in a little garage. like type thing, and then I woke up.\n",

And they were all in our living room kind of sitting around and lazing around like they do. And I think Mom and Dad were somewhere in the house. And I think they were all trying to get a surprise together for me because they were wanting me to go over to the pool and swim at the pool for a while and leave them be at home. And in my dream this pool was located kind of in the same place that Circle Lake is, so it was only a hop and a skip away. Somehow I crossed the street and everything. So I put on my bathing suit, head out the back door, walk down the alley and go over to the pool, and I swim at the pool. And I would come home early and I would do everything I could to be quiet. I would leave the pool gate very carefully, I would sort of walk slowly down the alley and into the back, but Dad would always be working in the garage and he would always see me coming home. So I would come in the house and say hi to everybody and then go back to the pool. So I did that a couple of times, like three times. And the last time I came in, I was pretty sure I saw them wrapping something, or something like that, and then they were going to pile in the car and go somewhere. I'm not sure where; it could not have been a restaurant because we had food in the car that we were eating. I had my 7. eleven cup that spills if you just breathe on it the wrong way. I had some kind of food that I was trying to eat and trying not to let it spill. All the girls were in the back, Mom was next to me and Sam was driving, and Dad was not around. Whoopee! And Sam was driving well, I mean we were just going on an adventure, having fun, and I woke up before we ever got where we were supposed to go.\n",

      "'Telepathic' I am with Dan, daytime, in Phoenix; we are looking at houses to buy. I get separated from him in a huge crowd. We are now at a huge civic center where there are many buildings in a huge complex set apart form the city, like a county fair but this has a stadium attached. I cannot find my cell phone to call him, instead I find a high teach square phone. flip top that has different unknown functions. I cannot figure out how to use it. As I walk in this huge building full of people, I recognize an old schoolmate from middle school Jermaine. He looks great, successful, like a celebrity. I do not say hi, thinking he would never recognize me. He has an entourage with him Jermaine had dated a good friend of mine but when her mother found out they were sneaking out at night, she up and moved 200 miles away, overnight. I was very anxious and distraught, very upset that Dan did not turn around or come back; he just left me there. I did find my cell phone, but could not dial correctly or remember the number ironically I was dialing my number, not Dan's and realized it much later in dream. Suddenly Jermaine sits down next to me on a small circular bench, I did not notice until I turn to ask him if I could use his cell phone. I realize it's Jermaine; he and his entourage have nice long sports jackets and suits MTV rapper style and he say's something like 'I knew it was you! How are you doing?' He looked excited, interested, and genuinely happy to see me. I was a bit relieved and excited he remembered me. We hugged, I asked him if he knew how to use this strange new cell phone I had found. He knew exactly, but dialed a 1. 800 number. I wondered if he was calling his calling card number. I ended walking with them for some time. On my cell, Jermaine shows me a baseball diamond that has digitally appeared. I am in awe, it is in gold like letters on a baseball marquee. I tell Jermaine I am lost and need to call Dan. He is sympathetic. At this point the dream morphs into me being kidnapped. As I walk through this civic center, I recognize another middle school friend Jenna but she's older like Jermaine and I. We stay together, friendly and happy to reunite. We also see two other middle school guys who were the Jerks or Geeks of the school one is Josh, annoying, rude, etc. and white; incidentally Jermaine had a white mother and black father and another black guy, cannot remember his name also a pest, dork, with bowl haircut. I realize we are all being held hostage and cannot leave this civic center. I think Jermaine's group was the captors. We Jenna and I are forced to pair with Josh and the other black geek. I wonder why I cannot be paired with Jermaine but he is aloof and not available. I am disgusted and try to escape. The FBI are outside monitoring, but at the same time keeping us inside so as not to disrupt the 'raid'. I break free from the outer zone and am able to use my old cell, this time realizing I need to call Dan's cell phone. When I call, my older sister Leah answers. I am shocked why is she answering Dan's phone?. She immediately starts talking, not giving me a chance to explain my predicament. She's hysterical; something to do with moving out of her house and it not being finished. I ask her if Dan's there and tell her 'I'm kidnapped!' I repeat it twice. She puts Dan the phone and he say's 'get the car and drive home; we'll be able to see each other tonightmorning. ' I say 'I do not have the car, did not you take it? Or do I?' He say's 'Yes, you do!' The dream ends. I realized that Dan had his hand on my leg when I woke up Mandy sleeps between us at night, so this is rare!. When Dan awoke, I was writing this dream, right at the end. I asked him if he dreamed and he said yes, 'I had a dream that you were kidnapped, it was really weird. ' Very strange, same time early in the morning we were dreaming.\n",

I drive down a one. way street in this maze of parking lots and end up in a small beach front cul. de. sac that I had not known existed. The man is falling asleep, the van keeps tipping over but it's easy to right up and I finally stop because each time I try to drive straight back up this small incline, the way I came, I get bogged down in sand.

Third part of dream we end up leaving and getting terribly lost in this maze of concrete walkways that line the apartments. It's a huge complex with paved sidewalks leading to different area dorms, exercise spas, bars, pools outdoor and in. It's a crazy mess. I keep taking my shoes off good tennis shoes and leaving them in different places. I go through pools and take short cuts around sunbathing college students. I jump paths and am constantly backtracking. I loose J. C. and the other friend. One scene I go through a huge pool and 2 big football players grab my back and hop on for a piggy back ride. I yell to them to let go and keep walking, trying to shake them. I remember going through a busy sports bar, people everywhere. I try to get back to the parrot house to ask directions but cannot find it. I notice a group of dorms that are different colored more ruddy red and are The Woodland Dorms. They are nicer and quieter, more mature or for the adult, farther along college student. I never find the way out I loose my friends and my shoes.\n",

      "My most recent absurd dream was the other night. During the day, Jack was talking about how unruly middle school kids are, so that may be why I dreamt about being back at my middle school. In my dream, I needed to return to my middle school to take one class that I had failed, and nobody brought it to my attention while I moved on to high school. In the building, the floors, walls and ceiling were carpeted with thick, dark carpet. There were little lanterns at the ends of the halls. The stairwells were more like ladders. The former principal was leading me by the arm, giving me a tour. Another lady had hold of my other arm. They were very friendly and glad to have me back, but they were very protective. They guided me as though I were very delicate and weak, physically. Just as I was about to settle into some classroom, I realized that I did not have anything I needed. Furthermore, I realized that the school was about to conduct a fire drill, and so I was running to the back of the building. I think I was suddenly juxtaposed to the high school's bus circle before awakening.\n",

      "The other day, my first night back in town, I had a really strange dream. I do not remember all of the details now, but what I do remember sure was wacky!! First, we had a Christmas tree up in the middle of July, in the usual place, the coffee table moved to the middle of the room. It was fully decorated, but rather than having the white sheet beneath it with the usual village, we had some fake presents, some statues and a snow globe or two on the wood floor. We did all of this because Cassie's Christmas tree caught on fire and burned up. She apparently had a stuffed giraffe, like the ones I saw in Viddler's, whose hair had ignited somehow, and eventually, the whole tree was on fire!! Their whole house was unscathed, but the tree was just gone, no ashes or nothing! So we set up a tree for them to look at in our house. Well, under the tree, we had this Santa figurine with an off. white base that would talk and tell stories and move, kind of like Big Bird. The base had a CD drive for program instructions and some weird electronic controls. Then, there was a Sebastian the Crab figurine that operated in a similar fashion. I was anxious to try them out and figure out what they might do, but I did not want to mess with them in front of everybody. That's all I can remember.\n",

I got to sit by Dusty and we got to talking and flirting then we were at my house and, well, he was flirting with me a lot and then we smoked cigarettes together. Then my mom came in and squirted us with a water hose and got us soaking wet and I was yelling at her so bad, then we went downtown. Then IDK, some people and I went somewhere but it ended up as a quest to help or find someone and we went through parking lots and like obstacles in a library. Then we came out and the parking lot was a pool full of celebrities and we had to find my car. Later on we went to the bowling alley and I was so unbelievably tired and was filling out another application. Then I came out with Katy and Andrew and Evan were sitting there waiting for us and we started talking. Then we left and could not find my car at all; we looked for days. Then we found it and Holly and I went to her house. It was her birthday and she got in trouble.\n",

      "I go to see Lila at her office. The area of her waiting room looks slightly narrower than it used to look. When I arrive, she has me sit down facing her in the waiting room and we are going to start the session. She gives some type of brief explanation like, her officemates she names them, using their first names are using her office. She is about to proceed with the session, as if this situation of us meeting out here were normal, and I intervene and say, 'May I know why they're using your office?' She says they are having a session with about 5 people, I get the feeling maybe it's a family or a group or something, and I think she adds something like, that it is drama therapy. So, apparently, text trails off, half. page of space So, thus, somehow, I realize that she is involved in drama therapy. I have mixed feelings about this discovery. On the one hand, it's another layer of connection between us or potential connection, because text trails off but on the other hand, it reveals to me something more about her personal life, and that scares me and makes me uncomfortable, I do not really want to see her as an ordinary human being involved in the drama therapy community; text trails off, a page of space I do not want to see her as a member of the New York therapists' community, as a regular human being subject to aging and death!, I want to see her as above all of that, and as somehow outside all of that, as existing only for me and not as a separate person with a separate life family, friends, community, etc. who likely may have all the foibles and fallibility of other members of the human raceI want to see her as a kind of bountiful goddess like Gillian!, a kind of Good Mother who has unlimited milk and who is larger than life and superior to life. I do not want to see her as a human being subject to decay and decline, nor as an ordinary woman who has a husband who may, potentially, also be ordinary, two children both of whom may, potentially, also be ordinary, a circle of friends which may, potentially, also be quite ordinary, a circle of neighbors and acquaintances and colleagues who may, potentially, also be quite ordinary. like the time I saw the photo I had taken of her, and the photo looked so much smaller than the picture of her in my mind. how I did not want to see that she was not actually larger than life, as she was in my mindshe looked too small and too humanit was painful and troubling to me I do not want to see her as someone who will die! or age! or have problems! especially personal problems! e. g. , marital, etc. I want to see her as text trails off, half. page of space When she says 'drama therapy', it occurs to me that maybe she got involved in that through or because of her husbandi. e. , she had a connection to and interest in drama, so now she has decided to get involved in the world of drama therapy. Just as we are about to start the session in her waiting room, and we have started a bit a few sentences, she says something like text trails off, one page of space, tremendous difficulty remembering, straining to remember she says something about 'greater intimacy' between us, something like that maybe having the session inside the boundaries of her office a safe, protected space, contained, there would be greater intimacy between us than having the session out here in her waiting room. note while typing this dream from the original text, I have a very strong impression that as I was having great difficulty remembering the above part, and was struggling to concentrate on it, I actually wrote it down differently from what had occurred in the dreamI believe, in retrospect, that in the dream she was actually saying that there would be 'greater intimacy' between us by having the session outside the boundaries of her office, i. e. , in the waiting room, i. e. , presumably because of the more casual, relaxed nature of the atmosphere outside of the formal therapy room; I am pretty sure that this latter view is the one that is the accurate representation of what was in the original dream, not the way it is written in the sentences above  in other words, I think that as a defense, I remembered and wrote it in the manner above rather than in the manner that it had occurred in my dream. Thus, in regard to the next passage, I believe that I disagreed, although it is written below as 'I agree. ' I agree. I do not feel comfortable holding the session out here in the waiting room even though she is about to proceed as if this is acceptablenormalokay. I intervene, and say something like, that I think that in order for there to be greater intimacy between us we need to be in a safe, protected space. It is paradoxical, but it's like, the greater and clearer and firmer the boundary, the greater the possibility for intimacy between usit is only in the safe, protected space of the therapy relationship with her that I can feel safe enough to be myself and to let her know me. The paradox is, basically, the greater the boundary, the greater the possibility offor intimacy. I say something like maybe in response to her, or maybe I'm the one who initiated the idea, I think there would be greater intimacy between us if we went back into the therapy room and did not try to proceed with the session out here in the waiting room. ' large space on page But her therapy room is, in this time slot, being used by her other colleagues so it's not clear what to do. At some point, she mentions something else about drama therapy, and I can see she has begun to get involved in that community. It occurs to me that maybe now that she is getting older she might want to get involved in some new things, some different things 'that which serves man in the noon of his life. ', and I do not want to know about it and I do not want to think about it and I do not want to deal with it. The way I feel, more or less, is something like let's go back into the safe, protected space of the therapy room where you and I are the only two people in the world and where time stands stilllet's go back inside, into the safe, protected space of the therapy room, where time stands still. 'time stops for no one. ' Let's go back into the safe, protected space of the therapy room where we are the only two people in the whole wide world and in which time stands still. 'Time stops for no one. ' time stands still. 'time stops for no one' time stands still. 'time stops for no one. ' time stands still. 'time stops for no one. ' time stands still. I want to go back inside! Let's go back, Lila. Let's!\n",

      "Last night I had an awesome technical sound dream! I have not had one like this in quite a while. First, I was on the front porch and there were two amps carrying a line. out signal from our receiver in the living room. The receiver was running its own set of speakers in the living room, but for some reason, we wanted to blast the signal even further from the porch! There was a regular guitar. like amp that was huge; it stood as high as my chest! I turned it up as loud as I could without hurting my ears, and Mom said it was only on 3. This cabinet was all black, I think it was made of fake wood. Then, there was a Leslie cabinet, carrying only the B sounds from the mix!! Somehow, it would turn itself on at the right time, carry the signal for a while, then turn itself off when that sound was not in the mix; wow! But I was in a predicament about how to turn these things off. I could not think of gain staging at this stage of my dream, so I just snapped off the power switch to the tall amp, with the understanding that the Leslie would take care of itself. Then, I was at this pro audio dealer place with Mom because I felt that one of my buddies from school worked there. I found him soon enough and asked him about the scenario on the porch. He seemed very concerned. According to this imaginary figure, if the amp had received a mic. level signal, and had to do the pre. amp stage to get it up to line. level, there was a hazard that it would catch fire if certain precautions were not taken. In that case, you'd have to wear a mask and touch it very gently. But he was relieved when I told him that either the receiver or the mixing console was already giving it a line signal. He then seemed irritated that I just came in to ask him a question and did not intend to buy anything. So I was deserted in this big store that resembled GFS because Mom scooted off to do some other shopping. I walked over to a blue plastic control surface that had at least 24 faders. I think it really was a mixing console for live sound, despite its color. I was touching its rear panel, in the main out section and considering the two main ways of handling the mixed signal. The first is to patch the main outs into your drive rack and let your crossover, etc. do its thing. Then, you'd just use the return lines of your snake to send it up to each of the amps. The second way was just to take your main L R and feed them into a single stereo musician. style amp cabinet and set it up on the stage somewhere and let 'er rip! I was trying to decide which way was best, when some old fat lady walked up and said in a frail voice, 'Can I help you?' So I started spouting off my thoughts to her about signal flow, gain staging and the best way to cover the audience. Before I got too far, she disappeared, and reappeared with this former buddy of mine. He did not resemble anyone in my class that I resemble. She walked away and let him listen to the rest of my monologue. He did not really seem too interested, or to have an opinion one way or another. I thanked him and walked out to sit on a bench in front. I was carrying a cloth bag with a square tin filled with pie! I had the notion that I had to give it back to somebody in the store before Mom came, but I did not know who. I felt this guilt that I had taken it from the store although I had no memory of grabbing it. Just then, I realized that I had no pants on!! And I had walked through the store that way!\n",

      "I had a goofy dream last night. I was in my bedroom packing up my older keyboard to prepare to deliver it to Curt's house. Actually, I had the older one and the newer one both laid out on my bed which was made, and their boxes stood up in front of my dresser. I was deciding which box to deliver the old one in, making sure that the accessories like the music stand and AC wallwart went with it. I also had wrapping paper and gift bows laying around, deciding whether or not to wrap it. The newer, longer Privia was balanced precariously across a blue plastic tub filled with gift wrap and stuff. I found a cassette tape in the old box, and I found a different cassette in the new box. They apparently contained opera arias, musical show tunes, 1930s swing numbers and other culturally significant things, and a narrator to tell about them and how to imitate their style. In this dream, both keyboards had a cassette deck, the slim style like you find in a car, or in Big Bird. It was located in the front to the right, kind of where you'd find a floppy drive on a digital mixing console. You were supposed to put in the tape, listen to the narrator and the songs, and try to play along when you could. There was some way to adjust the balance of the sound from the tape and from the keys. I fiddled with both units trying to make them work. The transport controls were on the console surface rather than down by the deck. The deck on the old one would not work very well at all, so I decided not to give Curt the tape that came with it. The deck on the newer one worked beautifully and sounded nice. I packed the older one in its case, because the box really got beat up at the store and then laid the newer, longer one in a more stable position. I was interested to hear what was on the tape. I faded into consciousness. I awakened realizing that neither one actually had a built. in deck, nor did it come with a 'cultural awareness' tape.\n",

      "I had a dumb dream last night. I was with Mom, some teachers and about 25 college students, and we were all going on some organized Spring Break trip to an island or theme park. I felt that it was Hawaii, where Cassandra went with Penny. First, I was riding an elevator trying to figure out where I was going. Once I got on the right plane, I found everybody that I was supposed to find. We flew like usual. But then, suddenly I realized that there were no windows or top to the plane, and it was floating in shallow water like a boat. Nobody was alarmed, for the pilot did this on purpose. Apparently, we were very close to our destination. Next thing I knew, we were all swimming rather than walking as we went about our actions and conversations. Our setting was similar to the water. playground at Adventure Island, except that the water was much deeper. Beforehand, a survey was taken from all of the traveling students with the question 'Which celebrity guest would you most like to accompany us on our trip? The top three most selected people would be invited to go with us. I put Bruce Hornsby, and he was one of the top three, so he got invited, and he came. So as we were all swimming through this little playground and back to the boat like little mermaids, I was asking about where he was, and when he'd be coming to join us. Somehow, I entered this dark little room underneath the playground equipment because I got lost. There was sufficient room for my head to be above the water without bumping the ceiling, and light was coming in, so it was not really all that scary. I felt afraid though because there were big doors, like you'd see in any modern building today, where a push. bar lets you out. I did not know if they'd sound any alarms. I called for help from the top of my lungs for a while, but nobody seemed to be hearing me or caring about my plight. Finally, some sympathetic college girl opened one of the doors for me and let me swim out. I found Mom in ankle. deep water conversing with some teacher. She was right outside the door, almost. I was disturbed and a little slighted that she was too busy talking to hear me calling. Then, when she was done, we set off together to go find Bruce Hornsby. The two of us walked down this little boardwalk through this nature. trail area. There was a Muscovy duck in the pond. Mom said that the duck was Bruce Hornsby's embodiment, and that he was no longer walking around as a human. Therefore, I would just have to talk to the duck. I felt that she was saying this just to keep me from looking for the man further, so I was pretty upset. I stamped on the hollow wood as we turned around. Next thing I knew, we were on grounds that looked like Macadams, but it was right at the water's edge rather than at the top of the pier. We had rejoined the group, which was bustling around, ordering food and talking while Bruce Hornsby the man was setting up for a concert. I had found him at last. He had an audio mixer instead of a keyboard, balanced on top of two huge speakers. Come to think of it, I believe he had an acoustic piano mic'd up going into that mixer. I did not converse with him at all. I woke up before I could.\n",

We go up the escalator and the crowd is so thick. Bob grabs my hand so we do not get lost from each other and I feel a tingle, almost like a shock. I look at him and I can see he feels it too. As we enter the hall to get to our seats, we let go of hands. We sit down and neither one of us says anything. We watch the show. At intermission, we go out to the concession stand. He asks me if I want a beer. I say yes. Again, it is very crowded. I stand in front of him at the concession stand and he puts his hands on my shoulders. I feel the tingle again. I lean very gently back, sort of resting on him, thinking, 'what the hell am I doing?' We get our beers and go over to a hallway to drink them. We are chatting and laughing and all of a sudden, Bob leans down and kisses me right no the lips. Talk about a tingle, it is more like an electrical current going through my body! I pull away and ask, What the hell are you doing?' He just smiles and says 'It's time to go back to watch the show. ' We go back and neither one of us talks the entire time. After the show, I invite him in for coffee. He follows me to my house which is where I live now. We are in the foyer and Lucky, my cat, is on the steps watching us. I am on the bottom step, Bob is by the door. He says, 'I'm not coming up for coffee tonight, but we need to talk about what happened tonight' I tell him I just want to be friends, he says 'It's too late for that now. Our friendship has evolved into more. I felt it tonight and so did you. You cannot deny it. ' He invites me to a party at his house on Saturday night. He is having some of his friends and colleagues from work over. I ask him what the attire is and he says semi. formal. I agree and he tells me to be ready at 7pm to be picked up. I agree. He comes over to the stairs and I am waiting for him to kiss me. I want him to kiss me. He hugs me and kisses me on the cheeks and says, 'I will see you on Saturday. ' He turns and walks out the door.\n",

      "Charity my niece and I are going to the drive. in. She is driving my beetle. bug that has no back seat. She is driving because I am trying to teach her how to drive a stick shift. She is doing very well. We get to the drive. in, park and are ready to see two movies. I decide I have to go to the bathroom before the movie starts. I did not wear shoes, just in my stocking feet. We start walking towards the bathroom and Charity says she thinks her marriage is falling apart. We stop to talk and she says her husband Bryan is very mean to her and does not communicate very well. I just listen, and then say to her, 'I am not sticking up for Bryan, but I have heard you talk to him very nasty too. ' I tell her she should try to work things out with him. I ask her if his drinking is a problem? She bows her head and says yes. I hug her and tell her I love her and to get some professional help. We get tot the bathroom and there is a bench in front of the door with about six ladies waiting to go to the john. I ask them if they are waiting for the john and they say yes. It's a single toilet with a pot to pee in. Charity and I go in while the six are watching the movie. She goes for the toilet and I laugh and say thanks a lot! Of course, the toilet is disgusting and I uncover the pot. It is as clean as a whistle. I crouch down to pee and nothing comes out. I ask Charity to run the water in the grimy sink. She does and I finally go to the bathroom. I empty the pot in the toilet and we leave the bathroom. Outside the bathroom is Paul He is the Facility Director where I work. He is waiting outside for me. He claims he saw me going to the bathroom. He says his girlfriend, Lesley is in the car watching the movie. We discuss work and I say I have to get back to the car with my niece. Charity and I start walking back and time has turned back for me only. I am in my twenties. We come across a bunch of people watching the movie on the back of a pickup truck. Kevin is one of them. He jumps down and says hi. There is another guy who also comes over. He is oriental. The people are all laughing, drinking, and having a grand time. One guy tells a joke and everyone laughs. Another guy pretends he is going to kiss another guy. This part is very weird. We walk back to the bug, Kevin comes with us and so does the oriental guy. We get back to the bug and the car is filled with illegal aliens and one older woman with white hair. There is now a backseat in the bug and about twenty people in it. They will not get out. I tell them I am going to call INS on them if they do not get out of the car. They get out and sit on a bleacher next to us, watching the second movie. Kevin and I crawl into the backseat and Charity and the oriental in the front. We watch the movie and Kevin turns to me and says, 'I have been waiting wall my life for you. ' I turn to him and say. then I wake up!\n",

      "I was having a really crazy dream last night that some dumb guy wanted me to run for President. He was a cross between Bart Schneider and Shawn, who I met at the party last night. More about that later. He seemed to overflow with the best of intentions, but was extremely out of touch with reality, a little like Astrid's grandpa. In the dream, it seemed totally plausible I would register to become a candidate for the highest office in the country and win voters' hearts and minds based on my personality, and the fact that I was a star pianist. In this dream, I must have been famous already. I had nothing to say to people regarding the country's political issues, and I had absolutely zilch in terms of political experience. I did not have a cent in terms of campaign funds, but according to this guy, I would not need any. I'd travel around in a bus like Johnson did for a while there, staging these people. drawing events around the country where I'd just stand up on a stage and talk about myself, beguiling the crowds with my egotistical charisma. The action in this dream takes place when this guy and I were setting up this stage. like thing behind some big building in a huge field. We were debating where to put the stage so that it would not wreck any sprinkler heads or other strange covers sticking out of the ground. They were going to erect a huge movie screen behind me to show pictures while I talked. Where was the PA? I do not know. Anyway, I was standing on a little dirt path while they were messing with the platform, and we were beginning to think that we could not stage our little rally here because of the strange things in the field. At first there were only one or two, but more appeared by the minute. Just then, I became very, very frightened of those things, realizing that I was standing very close to many of them. Some were sprinklers, some were raised manhole covers, some were littler covers with holes in them, some were little boingy spiral tube thingies mounted on little covers and some were soft, rubbery covers that have a funny vibrating quality because of a sound coming from down in a tube beneath the ground. I called out for the man, not by name, not even with a voice, and he picked me up and carried me back onto the bus. Then I woke up.\n",

      "My dream was really weird last night. First I was living in an apartment with 4 other girls and 5 other guys. I was trying to make everyone go to sleep, but Jessica had a tennis match and was making a lot of noise. Then there was another guy with long dirty blonde hair, sort of like a California surfer. I guess we had been dating for a while. He was hugging me and saying, I'm surprised I have not broken you yet. And I got really scared because I did not want to be with him. I suggested we make oatmeal in order to distract him. He poured his down the sink, which hurt my feelings for some reason. Finally, my father, my mother, and I were all driving in New Haven, but my father could not drive properly, so my mother had to take over. Weird.\n",

We went and started to watch this weird show on a big drive. in movie type screen, then a big Christian group came in and, I do not know, Jon was there and hitting on me the whole time and asked me out. I forgot what he said and he sent me a text message that said, 'One week. ' When I went home, it was an unfinished house and everyone was at the table. My mom yelled at me for something.\n",

      "Before that, in the middle of the night, I was dreaming that we had a 7. foot grand piano in our back yard, back between the tree house ladder and the side of the house. That's odd, you see 3 ft, 6, ft and 9 ft, but 7? Strange. The finish was that shimmering, perfectly smooth satin, in black. Sam's has a finish like that, so does Erica's. I had the notion that Mom had won it on Ebay for 950, and again, I felt lots of fears. What a fine instrument, but where will it go, and how will it be received. Anyway, we had three older people visiting us, and Mom and Dad. Two of the other people were relatives from my relative's home town, but the older man was Grandpa on my dad's side. He was lounging in one of our lawn chairs, very tired and weak, but he seemed contented and thrilled that I was doting on him. The others were walking around getting a tour of the yard and house. I was getting set to play for Grandpa, and discovered that Dad was pouring water into the case of the piano! He said it would magnify the brilliance f the sound, and I was not really horrified as I am now to think of it.\n",

      "Last night I first had a dream that I was kidnapped and being held hostage in the woods. Our cell phones would not work, and the people who had kidnapped us had taken our kayaks and paddles. My next dream was that I was playing hockey with my women's club team, but something was wrong, like one of the girls was not allowed to play. Then I was in the dining hall and I think Michelle had died because I kept crying every time I tried to eat. Then I was on an Outing Club trip with Jessica, Kim, Sydney, and Abigail. Rem and Kat and left behind all our spandex, so we were really embarrassed that we had nothing appropriate to wear. Alec tried to help us find them, which did not make it all any less embarrassing. But then I think in the end we all went snowshoeing.\n",

      "I had a mixed. up, but rather nice dream last night. First, I was on the couch with Sheryl, and I think we were both much younger. There was a big envelope where there were 5 color 8 X 10 photos of scenes from The Little Mermaid and one or two coloring pages. Mom said that she'd sent away for them in one of those cereal box top things. Sheryl was laying them out and making a story with them. The story was that the castle had a library in it, and Ariel was saying that she was going to be the smartest person in the kingdom because she went there often. Boy, how cuckoo! Then, I faded into another scene. Jack was preparing to drive our car. I had given him my key ring. In this dream, I guess I must have been carrying a car key along with my house keys. As we were getting settled, he handed my keys back to me and asked me to start the engine. I felt that he just wanted me to feel powerful although I could not drive. I was a bit perplexed, and slightly afraid. He assured me that it was in park, and then, I felt a little better. So I put the key in and turned it, and heard the engine turn over and begin to run. Then, I gave my keys back to him. In our ignition, the key does not have to stay in. Then, it was just the two of us, but during our ride, Mom appeared somehow. I do not know where we were going, but I felt we were on some adventure trip. I was sitting between Jack and Mom in the front seat, just like Dad, Mom and I sit. Mom was telling Jack little things that he needed to know, like where the turn signal was. Jack stopped for a moment, and Mom and I jumped out to drop some letters into a mail box. Then, when we hopped back in, Mom was sitting next to Jim. And then, suddenly, something was strange. Its handling felt just like it did when we were having transmission problems. So Jack deftly steered us into a hot parking lot. Before anything more could happen, Mom said that it was doing this because Jack had manually shifted into Low. She called him Jimmy boy, just like Dad. Jack shifted us back into drive, and we were off again. And then, I woke up. That was a little goofy, but kind of nice.\n",

      "After a nap. I'm chasing after an artifact in the islands. The small bead. string of land is somewhere remote in the Caribbean. They are pine islands, scrub forests and shanty settlements. Shallow sea and reef lay in between. Large companies have set up some mysterious operations on one of the larger islands, requiring copious amounts of power. The adventure begins when I hijack a twin. engine split. tail seaplane and fly into this island in pursuit of a bad guy. I'm with a close ally in the plane. Someone who I care about and trust. The bad guy has henchmen. They thwart our escape. We incapacitate or kill many of them, but they slow us down enough for the bad guy to escape in a small, single. engine plane. We've been in pursuit for months. I was not going to let him get away. In a mad, desperate, injured dash, I make it to my waiting plane. I cannot really fly well. But I am co. pilot anyway. The bad guy has a smaller, more maneuverable plane. He takes off through the mess of power lines. At first I do not think it's an issue . but we soon learn there's no way to blast skyward with the big plane's power with the lines overhead. Instead, we fly low under them and try to accelerate. The bad guy zips out and takes off toward another island.\n",

      "182. My friend Cindy and I were hanging out outside. It was dark and foggy. We were in this wooded type place, with a bunch of trees with fruit. We took them and started to throw them at the trees and various things, then a guy and his son pull up in a truck and ask us what we are doing. We reply, 'Ya know nothing, just throwing these. ' He asked us why and we said that we were bored. Then he started to yell at us telling us to leave. Then I yelled at him, 'Fuck you, start the revolution, Ron Paul!' And he goes, 'Did you just say Ron Paul?' and shook his head. Then later on Mike and I were walking in the same area. We came up to this really cool house and decided to break in. It was uphill and he would have to drive his jeep through there and through a fence and hole. So he does. We go in but do not rob it. Then my friend Cindy calls and tells us that the house we are in belongs to the two guys talking to us earlier, and they are on their way home! We start to freak out. We hear a knock on the door but it was just Steven in a sweater and goofy glasses. We yell at him to leave. In the midst of all of this I find a bunch of tiny white kittens. We debate if we should take them or not. We do not and then just butt out of there like a very dramatic movie scene. We get all the cars out in time using pulleys. There is dramatic theme music playing. They all drive off as I am climbing down, and start to run like crazy. Then all of a sudden I am in a downtown area. People drove by in a 1920's car laughing at me. Later I met up with everyone and we had made it out safe. Then it turned out that it was Mrs. Benncort's house that we 'robbed. ' It was a red and yellow building that she was shutting down from us and she was pissed. Then the dream changed. I was at a building restaurant type place and Travis Harrison was my boyfriend. He and I were texting each other. Then I say, 'Bye' and 'Hi,' he kisses me. Travis got mad. I was in Mrs. Benncort's office. She lay down on the table. Some guy walks in and asks me if it was time for me to go to the gym. I said. 'Not yet. ' He said, 'Call me when you do. ' Then Mrs. Benncort told me she was not mad at me.\n",

Mrs. Benncort just being herself and I was in the parking lot  probably because the last play I kept on smoking out there  and then I saw Meredith walking out of the school. She was sitting on her dad's truck. Her dad was hardcore staring at me. Then she came over and sat in my car with me. Then her dad came and brought us little notes that had tiny bottles of fingernail polish in them. We just laughed and she left. I told Brooke that I had a dream with him in it. He had no reaction. I started to drive. It was a cold rainy fall day. Thinking I had to go to work. As I am driving I realize that I do not have to be anywhere. So I just started to drive and ended up at Silver Dollar City. It looked nothing like it. It had no same rides and it was by a mall. I started to talk to some people standing in line. They had been waiting awhile. It was 745 and they opened at 8. So I said, 'What the hell!' and waited to ride a ride. So I was talking to them, and I kept on seeing a white feather float. I made a remark 'Look, it's the Forrest Gump feather,' as the line started to move. I went and grabbed it. We kept on talking. Then I saw Hubert. We started to talk and I told him about the feather. I was going to give it to him, but I crumbled it up in my hand and it turned into blue clay. Then more waiting went on. I kept on saying jokes that made no sense like, 'My mom told me to never stand behind a gay man. ' He got upset that I said this out loud. There were different waiting areas that kept on moving up. There was a big glass window and we saw some kids sitting outside smoking a bowl. People were upset over this. So a woman went to go stop them and handed me her baby to hold and watch. It was a very odd. shaped baby. The very first thing it did was bite me! When we got to the top of the line, there was a big kitchen. They were making Oreo cookies and icing. Then I woke up late for school.\n",

I had to snowboard throughout Europe which was tricky enough since I cannot snowboard and steal art for my job in exchange for cocaine. And I do not know why but I was trying to acquire 40 grams of it. Aaron was there and was talking to Britta, even though he had come to visit me. I sent them on a tour of Europe to keep them busy while I tried to find the 40 grams of cocaine. Then I woke up.\n",

I go into the kitchen at the table to talk to them. Eric came in stretching and yawning and said, 'Hello, Mom and Dad. ' They were like everything's OK! Jamie's not in trouble.

      "Last night, I dreamed that I was at APC, supposedly in the Humanities building, but it looked more like a library. There was a large carpeted floor with big picture windows. There was a flood of natural light coning in the windows and a black carpet. There were hallways toward the back. I passed an office door with a paper sign taped to it, apparently the office of a college piano teacher. She was giving lessons to some young virtuoso. There was a chair propped against the door, apparently holding it shut, so I boldly sat in it, eavesdropping on their lesson. The elderly teacher spoke in a heavy Russian accent, and she and her student went over some really tough passage. I soon grew less interested in them, for they did not speak a whole lot, and I could not really follow what they were doing. I wandered out to the big front area, where college students and young children hung out, acting very similarly. They sat, crawled and rolled on the floor, talked, played with toys and such. The noise level in the room was not very loud, but it was chaotic nonetheless. There was a grand piano off to the side, and no one was near it, so naturally, I wandered over to play it. I cannot remember actually playing anything at first, but I do remember trying to play 'Moonlight Serenade. ' In this dream, I somehow made all of the right sounds, but my hands did not really touch the keys very much, or in the right hand positions at all. I could tell that someone was standing behind me, watching my hands, looking right over my shoulder. I felt it was Stuart Long from high school!! He sat down on the bench beside me, apparently very interested in what I was playing. He began getting very close to me, leaning on my shoulder, putting his arm around my waist, patting my shoulder. I was not sure I liked this or not. I felt that if I let this go on, he might do something else that I really did not want at all, and yet, at the same time, I wanted to be close to him, but felt funny because I did not feel he was the one that I wanted to be close to. I also felt strange because I was not sure I wanted to be close to anyone like that. I think I remember shoving him away a little, and he explained that he just wanted to see my hand positions yeah right. I do not know what else happened, but I remember agreeing to sit on his lap as I played, as long as he promised to keep his hands off of my chest. As I played, sitting on his lap, I faded into consciousness.\n",

The air in her tank disappeared and she had to live for a day on the scant air in the dungeon, which had filled up with even more water. In the dungeon with no air, I went in to help. There were doors, inside were creatures . venomous, toothy, dog. like beasts that were like hairless, slimy pit. bulls, but evil. I had a sort of map in my head of my abilities. Acid spray, fire bolt, disable, life drain . that sort of thing. I selected some, and then blasted one of the creatures when it came out at me. It did not do much. It was more powerful than my abilities. I beat it to death with my hands. The girl survived. She remained calm. Opened a passage, and used the air up in each one, slowly.\n",

      "I was lying in bed, basically with the intention of WILDing. and I fell into the all familiar sleep state without losing consciousness. At this point it felt like someone grabbed my feet and pulled me really hard. I landed on the ground, on my stomach and watched as I was being dragged through my apartment. I was dragged all the way to the far corner of my living room. It looked pretty much like my apartment except the couch was different. Then while I'm in the corner of the living room, something started to obstruct my vision. It appeared as if some type of web or cocoon was being spun around me, then it started looking like something similar to honeycombs. I decided to just sit back and see what happened next. Suddenly the honeycomb melts away and I'm under water looking at a sea full of beautiful fish. Really breath taking shit. I just observed for awhile and then my cat made a noise and I was back in the waking world. For the last few years I've had incredibly good luck with falling asleep without losing consciousness, it's quite a feeling. Usually I try to OBE but this time I had intention of going the LD route. It was quite enjoyable, albeit short.\n",

      "It started in a crowd, an urgent, threatening crowd. I got Hillary Clinton into the car, in the driver's seat. I sat in the passenger seat and had a hard time clicking the seat belt closed. We drove in silence and I kept looking over at her, trying to figure out what to say. She was a good driver, though a bit of a tailgater which makes me nervous. At some point, I was suddenly in the back seat, right behind her, and I had a big stack of papers on my lap that I was sorting into piles on the seat next to me. I was holding some paper clips between my teeth, which is perhaps why I spoke with a German. Russian accent. I told her, Senator Clinton, ma'am, I would be happy to drive if you have something else you need to do, but she just smiled and kept driving. On a highway we had to stop short just as we would have passed under a bridge, since a road crew was blocking almost the whole road, filling in a giant, muddy, watery hole right in front of us that had an orange road barrier sticking out of it, with more barriers around the hole. The workers were very focused on their jobs and did not look up. Hillary opened the door and got out, looking around, and so did I, thinking she wanted me to drive now. The workers began elbowing each other and muttering in South. of. the. Thames accents, Is not that Hillary, love? Then we got back in the car and she drove . backing up and turning to drive across the wide median to the other side of the highway, and we headed back the way he had come. She looked at me through the rear. view mirror and asked why I wanted to drive. I said, surprised that it was not obvious, Well, ma'am, because you are the next President of the United States, and I want to help you. I'm sure there is something you want to do besides driving the car. Even if it's thinking. Thinking is very important. I want to help you become the next President of the United States. She grew thoughtful. We arrived at a dining hall at the University of Virginia my undergrad. Bill Clinton was there. My heart leapt and I blushed when I saw him. Hillary and I got separated. I knew I was supposed to be meeting someone else there, yet I also knew that I was responsible for bringing the Clintons to the dining hall. Strange security measures were in place there trays bolted to tables, everything brightly lit, only one direction to walk in. I got a tray, silverware, an empty glass, and a monkey dish of pineapple. The Clintons and I sat in a row at a table and started talking. Then my parents . as they were 18 years ago . came up to us. I introduced them, but the Clintons already knew who they were. My Dad did a happy little jig, kicking his feet up, then my Mom pulled him away. I felt guilty, because it was my parents I was supposed to meet, and I apologized to the Clintons because I had to go with my parents, but they were like, No no no, stay here.\n",

      "I was working at the newspaper where I interned. I had gotten there early. But I was tired, and a little hungry. Everyone was there, the vets and all of the young people. Luckily someone brought cupcakes. Both white and chocolate frosting. I ate one vanilla. Then I went for another. Then I realized I was tired. The day was going by slowly. I put my head down on my desk and fell asleep. I thought I had only been passed out for a minute or so, but when I awoke, it was apparent I had been out for some time . you know, that unknowing guy drooling and snoring in an inappropriate place, while everyone steps over him to do real work. I finally woke up and realized the time. I felt compelled to go out and do something. So, rain coming down, my car still musty from the sunroof incident, I started driving. I drove north, toward the bad part of town, but not quite there. I stopped at my bank to look for a story. Instead, I ended up driving around and then I realized something and needed to go back. The parking lot was a maze. I went around three or four times, cutting through the drive. thru banking center until I finally decided to turn into the bank's outdoor stairway leading inside. My car cleared the teller counters, hit the tile main floor and then I proceeded out the open front doors and down the main steps. I got out of my car, which may have been stuck, and picked up a modern, skinny skateboard. I saw another skateboard on the ground, it looked nice . I could use it as a backup. But it was missing the front trucks and wheels. I began to try to skateboard. I felt unbalanced, but I got up and was able to cut and turn like I knew what I was doing. Two young skateboard guys were in front of me. They stopped and I fell as I ran into them. They said sorry indirectly. They looked at my board and said they once saw one you could kick and it would come up. I said yeah, a NASH skateboard. Everyone had one back in my day. We continued down the concrete path. They kept getting in my way. One pushed me, and I took a left path toward what doubled as the Reitzbuilding of the newspaper where I interned. I made the turn down a side path but then veered into the grass. I got up and went into the building. I went into the bathroom, and for some reason I put on a shirt and a thick coat and left my pants behind. I took the elevator up to the newsroom. Then I realized I had no pants on. It was night, so the office was dark. I dashed back into the elevator level. I hoped nobody saw me. I took the elevator back down to the safety of the bathroom. Once inside, I stepped into a stall and started to pee. It was the sort of after. sex pee. The stall door was broken. I was still wearing the heavy ski coat. Then the security guard came in. I ignored him and continued to pee. Then he came in and started watching me, under the guise of fixing the door and keeping watch. I said Alright, nothing to see here. Everything's fine. He said ok, ok but did not move. I got angry and said, leave me the fuck alone, let me pee in peace, goddamn it. He finally moved. I finished and went to the sink. He followed me. I told him to leave me alone. But because he saw I had no pants on and he was a pervert, he stepped close to me and gave me an ultimatum. I nodded, ok, but instead, punched him and grabbed away the gun he was waving around. I also, somehow, had a makeshift grenade. I backed away and pointed the gun at him. It was a big gun . it was big in my hand, black, with more stylized points than most. Like a slightly smaller desert eagle. I held the gun in my right and the grenade in my left. It was tough holding the grenade so tightly with one hand, so I changed hands. I told him he should have made his move then, and that he's too cowardly to even try anything. He stepped closer and said I would not have shot. He sat down on a stool near the mirrors and laughed at me, said I would not shoot if he made a move. He made a taunting false. move, and I pulled the trigger. The shot hit him in the face, right underneath his right eye. The hole was massive. It could have been a kill shot, but then again, people do survive shots to the face. I look at the gun. It has a clear clip that was so long it stuck out. I had a lot of shots left. I thought, man, I should have shot him in the kneecap or something. But he was not dead. He was talking. But burbling, and his right eye was turning bloody and yellow. Then, I decided to kill him. I fired all over his head and face, carefully, but he was not dying. Somehow things fast. forwarded to a future documentary. He was old and disfigured, like someone and sewn his face back together with rough stitches and frozen icicles. He was a mad scientist or something, with a secret mechanical lab. Next, I go back to the newsroom. Things get strange. I end up being a killer, contemplating killing a girl every night. I have the gun. And I go out and stalk a girl. I enjoy that more. So I do not do anything. One person is with me. Another wants to be killed. I throw rocks at her till one hits her and she goes down. Another just lays down and decomposes. I throw a rock at her, and hit makes an indent on her ghoulish body, her face is like a snakefish's head. Pointy teeth, round head. The rock unhinges her jaw and it flips up. I put my sandaled foot on it to put it back down. I think this is disgusting, as I got her decomposing flesh on my shoe. Cleaning solvents to fix it.\n",

      "I argue with a man at a zoo manatee exhibit. He is telling his wife and infant daughter they are carnivorous. I tell him they're not. They eat plants. He tells me, no, they eat meat. I say to him, look, they're eating water lettuce right now. They're larger than the usual kind of manatee. So I could be wrong. But that would be impossible. Look at them, slowly swimming around. He says they could eat fish. And I said to look at how slow they swim. They're like cows. They could be like whales and eat small stuff, but I know that's not true. I walk over to a tour guide and ask what they eat, are they carnivore or herbivorous? She says something about imported pigs, but then I clarify, Me and this guy are having an argument. do they eat meat or plants. The attractive black woman says oh, plants, and I prove the guy wrong. She then says, It's not like sand people trivia or anything. The comments on the placard near the manatees has people talking about Star Wars. I flirt with her Do they travel in twos or single file? Are they easily scared, or brave? I think of more when I walk away.\n",

      "I had a crazy, crazy dream last night! Oh, by the way, crazy dreams mean I've been sleeping well. In this dream, Mom had some kind of trip planned, to Asia, India, China, or someplace in the east like that. She was going to stay about 2 months. I did not really have that much of a desire to travel to that part of the world not a strong desire like I have to one day go to Europe again. I decided, however, two days before Mom left, that I did not want to stay home with just Dad in the house for 2 months, so I decided I was packing my bags and going with her. I was going to miss lots of school, and I was figuring what to do about that, but I was okay with that. The actual action in this dream began with some quick, disorganized, inadequate packing. I was not packing too much at all, just two tops, a bra, one pair of shorts and some underwear. I decided I'd throw in a sketch pad too. Then, I was downstairs on the night of our departure. Our flight was supposed to leave at 1000 PM, and we were supposed to have been at the airport at 9. But of course, it was 1020 and Mom was still fiddling and diddling around the house!! I felt, however, that there were other flights throughout the night that we could get on without a problem. And we were to ride the tandem to the air port!! To make this situation even sillier, we were taking Peboo with us! Pete and Genevieve were out of town, and we just could not leave the little birdy all by himself. So we put him in my bag, which had lots of room since I had not packed much at all. So, he did just what you'd expect any little bird to do, he made a mess in my bag. But it was a big mess, more like about what a pigeon would leave, and my bag stunk to high heaven! There was no way we were going to slip that through the airport! So, there we were, stopping with the tandem outside of 711 late at night, on our way to the airport, having to clean up my bag. And then, I woke up!\n",

      "I was shopping for counterfeit handbags on a busy street in Chinatown with some of my friends. A number of the vendors had radios tuned to the same station, which was playing a modern jazz song. When the song ended, the DJ said, Now it's time for Barack Obama, live from Hawaii!. Barack's voice came on, and said, My fellow citizens, this has been a long, hard campaign, and I am very tired. It's a rocky path I must travel and I just do not know if I can make it. Then he sang Ole Man River and the entire street fell silent. For the duration of the song, everyone just stood and listened.\n",

He gave me a playful nudge and said, I just love you! This made me ridiculously happy. When we reached the car, he had trouble fitting into the passenger seat because his legs were so long. The back seat was down and needed lifting. I was afraid he would make me lift it by myself, but he helped me. Then we drove to the mall.\n",

      "It was a holiday, and to celebrate I entered a freestyle fighting competition down at the local park . it reminded me of the soccer fields in a park I know. I'd made it through several rounds, and I was in the final bout. It was against a big, fat guy. He was not much taller than me, but could have weighed nearly twice as much. He had on a white shirt. I was wearing a pair of black cotton martial arts pants and a plain shirt. We traded blows and grapples. I felt strong, confident. He could not get me down. And despite the many blows I landed, they did not seem to defeat his resolve at all. The judges called a break. A third fighter was introduced . a wildcard. His job was just to intervene and mix things up. The fat guy backed away. I decided I had enough energy left just to deal with him quickly. I knocked him to the ground with a sweep and then felt I had the strength . he was lighter than me . to grab him by the legs and swing him out of the ring. It would have been faster than wearing him down with blows for a k. o. I succeeded. He got out of the ring and did not return within the required three seconds. I then turned to the fat guy, but the judges called another break. This time for water. I talked to him and a fan base had gathered around me and my competition. Sides had been taken. I said, no matter who does win, it's good to know I made it this far . into the final round. But money began to trade hands . and someone stuffed a wad of 100s into my black belt. I took it all out and put it in my pockets. This was bet money. Thousands more was being traded under a tent with a limo under it. This is where the civility began to unravel. At the start of the next round, the competition bolted from the ring. He ran to the limo. I waited for three seconds to pass, so I would at least win on a technicality. Then I began pursuit. I ran, put the guy had jumped in. He was fleeing with all the bet money. I did not care . I did not even think there was a prize. But I wanted closure. I wanted the satisfaction of knowing that I beat him. The limo tore of . and mob. types in the crowd . and some apparently paid. off policemen . began shooting. The glass shattered around me. I ran back to the judges' tent and began talking to one of the refs or a journalist or someone. I know I won, but I'd rather win the right way, not on a technical knock out. If he came back, I'd give him the chance to prove himself, if he agreed that I had won the competition by the rules. But then the cops started to break everything up. My trainer and a friend began to run . when they were cut out of their money, they got pissy. My contingent ran to the police chief's command van. As the officersthugs began to literally extort and steal people's money as evidence, I told him he could not do this, and people in these parts had guns. But he said, maybe, but we have these. he raised a new, high. tech smg rifle. And I said, yeah? So what? and punched him in the face. He went down, but went for his radio, which had dropped. I picked it up and moved it away. I also took the smg, his automatic pistol handgun and an old. fashioned wood. stock soviet. looking sniper rifle, minus a scope, from the ground near him. I knew we had to move . fast. My trainer had his own smg. My friend, I gave him the rifle and said to guard the police chief . we could have held it, but we also needed to go and clear out the crooks. I wanted to leave him the automatic pistol, which looked strange, with a short barrel and clip storage on top, with some kind of extra grip brace. I wanted the range. But I thought I may need the pistol later. Plus, he'd be able to pick off anyone who approached the van it was in the middle of the field first with the rifle. We headed off. Also, I checked the guns for shoulder straps . the smg and the rifle had them, so that could not factor into the decision. We rounded a corner in a residential neighborhood. An old, sagging wooden house stood there, and two thugs were in the alleyway, crouched down, guarding the entrance in the middle of the street. I hefted the smg, and depressed the trigger slightly. A green beam lanced out. I traced it on the thug's body. A red beam followed mine and trained on the second guy. My trainer knew what he was doing. As I saw them begin to notice the beams, I opened fire. The gun was on automatic. The bullets lanced out over the 30 yards and peppered his body. He went limp. My trainer fired fewer shots. I was worried his target might not be completely dead. But then I looked at the bodies in the dim alleyway light. We'd killed them so fast; they were slumped over where they stood. Then we got closer . a dog had been crouched next to the guy my trainer killed. It was unharmed. It bolted. I raised my rifle and fired without aiming at it as it headed for a corner. The bullets flied all around it. I do not know why I was shooting . it's not like the dog could warn anyone. But if it arrived bloodied and alone, the others would know something's wrong. I could feel its pace. and in its final bound before it rounded the corner, I hit it twice on its flank. It made it around the corner, but I doubted it would get much further. Then we entered the house. I had a glove on my left hand, but not my trigger hand. The trigger had grown hot. A downside to this high. tech weapon. I took the pistol out of my pocket. I knew the litting thing would spit fire like a dragon in these close quarters. It's snub. nose would make it even more versatile inside than the smg. Plus, I only had one clip inside each weapon . the smg could run out at any moment. I decided to switch the fire mode . it had four . auto, four burst, three burst and a couple other modes. The pistol had auto, semi and safe. Inside was a disaster. Water was leaking, I do not remember any smells, but I remember thinking I'm glad I cannot smell, it would be awful. The shower was dripping, and it looked like a person had been cut up into tiny chunks and was rotting inside. We cleared the house . it was empty. Then I saw a bank tube, the kind used for drive through banks. Inside was a wad of cash wrapped in plastic. I took it out, showed my trainer, and stuffed it into the pocket I still had some of the fighting cash. I decided to exit via the window, jumping and using vines ripping from the wall to slow my descent. As I waited for my trainer to arrive, I listened to a downstairs apartment basement window . I heard voices from a radio coming through there. I listened close . and wanted to fire a few shots in . no way to tell if someone was waiting inside with a shotgun. Then, an Asian man rode up on a bicycle, threw a brown paper bag, and then fled. The bag caught fire . the blaze was large. I ran toward the edge of the flames to get past them before they got any larger. BOOM. The world became slow motion. The explosion shockwave flashed white. I jumped. And continued on the edge. I pulled the pistol and began firing at the guy. He was wearing a white shirt. I was waiting to see red spots. I kept missing, even though the little handgun sounded like a roar as it spat bullet after bullet. I expected my trainer to be following me. The bike guy rounded a corner outside a park . and there was an entire Asian gang there. the connections were getting deeper . cops, gamblers, organized crime. They did not seem armed. except for a big guy in the middle. No quantity of guns, but quality, my god . he had what looked like a SAW. But in the commotion, two of his own people ran in front of him as he opened fire at me. He was wearing a black, mandarin. collar suit. I opened fire when his two people went down. And my shots either hit or came close enough to cause him to fall back. I decided I was outnumbered . and out of ammo . and fled around the corner. This was not this world. There were a bunch of guys standing on the porch of this general store looking place. Inside, it was a gun shop. Even though both guns were 9mm, I asked for 5. 56 ammo. The guy said he was out. All he had was 6. 8 mm specialty ammo. Damn. He offered me the m4. like gun in the case . I had enough cash to make a deal, but it would be tough to find that ammo elsewhere given the running state I'm in. I wanted to ask for a referral to a different place or to just buy a gun with compatible ammo. I got a 9mm pistol and went outside . and the running began anew. It took me down stairs, and through an underground tunnel that took me to the edge of the city, where the world ended. It was a large lake that went off to infinity . or rather . a newly discovered realm that this place leads to. I went in with a group of trip. like people who I knew. It was a plateau surrounding a white sand, blue. water basin . with a resort in the middle. There were dinosaur. like creatures, extinct mammals and even a unicorn. I waded across and was hungry. There was a girl who was naked. She talked to me. She was like an island native with a successful business. And inside, she ran a hot dog stand.\n",

      "I had a pretty neat dream last night. I had the notion that the Lawrence Welk TV studio was somewhere in the middle of Pennsylvania, that all of the cast was still alive and that they were still producing new shows! I was looking at a brochure that described the studio's features; the studio lighting and curtain facilities, dressing rooms, even a blurb about the organ next to its picture. The brochure was mostly aimed at tourists who might want to be in the studio audience. There were thumbnails of some neat scenes. I had made up my mind to study maps and figure out where the studio was located. If it fell close to our route, I would have us stop there on our way up to my relative's home town. We would attend one of the show tapings, and I might get to meet all of the musicians. I wanted to tell Mr. Welk how I dreamed of being able to wield a baton like him. He might even let me try my hand on one song, and I would tell him that I felt most confident in 24. I might even get to play the organ while Joe Fini sings! Next, I was looking at a map which made little sense to me as I faded into consciousness.\n",

      "Began with me and my brother Gerald slashing through new. era lugians creatures in a video game called Asheron's Call we both played when we were younger in a cave to get me a hollow axe a weapon in that online multiplayer game. My current axe could swipe through each one in a single fall. After the hordes became too thick, we jumped out a tube with a yellow lift but many were inside. We met them outside and cut them down. They were beginning to turn into zombies. Legions of them. A bunch of young kids and rednecks began to arrive and slide down the tube that leads into the dungeon. I lead the way, others followed. A good group compiled. Including my little dog a childhood pet and someone to take care of her. The zombies were many. But I'd acquired a shotgun since. I was blowing them away. We were being pursued by the legion of doom, or whatever the big evil power was. The size and scope of their army was tremendous . but they had not yet arrived here in full. We were just battling the natural wild beasts. It was a big stone building like the main city with the indoril guards in Morrowind. And it had canals. Many canals. The dungeon had led us to an undergroundoutdoor type setting. I was supposed to meet my former girlfriend Annie , but she was at the end of our journey . at the shore. In a fortress by the shore. I was to keep her safe. There was a preppy swimmer in need of help, so I used my powers to let him qualify for a race and claim his royalty position in the countryside so Annie could marry him and go off to be safe there. They here married before I was to see her again. I saw her see me. And then they were gone. I was left in a pet store like place on an upper floor of the large building. I held a little dog and was happy that she was finally clean and happy. Then I knew we must continue. I went outside, and the zombies were thicker than ever. There were stacks of industrial cargo . we'd reached the shore area this was the bay side. To avoid the zombies, we jumped well, I jumped. the others had to knock stuff over to form bridges to get across. and ruined my stable jumplanding spots. A bag of special salt ripped and spilled down. And one zombie spoke to me. The salt cured or slowed the zombification process. Kill me . and it will be honorable, or something like that. I left him. And then the other bitten, but not. transformed zombie people gathered around. I threatened to shoot one of them if they tried anything funny. I stuffed salt into the barrel of the shotgun . hopefully it would be more effective against the next zombie. and then. The sky turned red and any light turned red. a dust storm came from nowhere. and the legion of doom descended. The feeling was as if death had come to snatch the life out of everything everywhere, only it was worth . that death would come only after all hope had been smashed out of you via torturous means. Thousands of lich warriors, brainwashed human minions serving a dark power. This was worse than Nazi Germany . it was like the force from the chronicles of riddik. Only with undead and a giant seaborne army, with a giant command ship. I went into the town. I killed a few guards to get in unnoticed and quickly went inside an abandoned building with a few close warriors. Should we wait until morning for the suicide mission to destroy their main ship? Maybe. I had a hunch. I went inside the building and in a room met a member of the resistance who was hiding out. I felt confident with my weapon as I raided the place. He said there were more like him. and he would join us in our raid. I got a good feeling from him. Then, when we were supposed to be low and quiet, the younger brother of one of our companions started shining his flashlight through a darkened window at people dining on the sidewalk outside. He wanted them to think it was a ghost. One couple did and were shocked. Another old woman pulled a gun out of her purse. aimed. and I punched him in the face and took him down. The bullet missed him, but splintered off and hit McCoy in the leg. I told everyone to hide. The guards were on their way. I left the idiot who brought the roof down and ran. I ran into a building that looked like an outfitter store that was being forced to close. My character turned into a petite young girl. I saw someone who looked friendly on the steps. then I revealed myself . these people looked good. They gave me some food. but then they wanted me to put on this control necklacetag for legal use only, it had on it. It was bright orange. The woman said, this will hurt less if you do it now. she came toward me . I yelled, I would rather die free than live in captivity! I ran. I spat the food back as I made it to the window. I had River. like from Firefly, a TV show powers. I jumped backward and did a flip to the ground. Just then, the building next door . the blue. suited rebel headquarters . was being attacked. Green sidewinder. like missiles were launched inside. They launched a huge missile back the other way. it grabbed the two missiles and exited the other side right in the mass of oncoming enemy troops. but it did not explode. it would have wiped them all out if it did. Then the psychic power enemy hero guy came in and tore out the minds of dozens of engineer. types as the poured out the front. the battle was over shortly. There were so many armed rebels. they were prepared. but when shit started flying, they went every which way. i watched as they were rounded up and stuffed into slave vans. I disabled a section of the fence to the camp from the outside . so I could escape if I were put inside. I tied down the razor wire so I could exit over the pole. Then as I war pursued by the bad women who vowed to hunt me down, I went to a backwater Bahamas. type place with old septic trucks and porta. potties. I thought about hiding, but realized running . getting distance on this place . would be better. I lost my clothes, save for a shirt, in the escape. There were black guys on motorcycles and mopeds. I offered to buy one. They were trying not to make girl prostitute jokes. I knew I could probably beat them all up and steal their bikes, but I decided against it. I asked to test drive a moped I could not reach the chopper pedals, plus it'd be easier to drive. He agreed. and then I took off, pedaling with the auxiliary. It was slower than I thought. They all came running after. they were running at super speed. I could barely get away. they grabbed my arms, but I peddled faster. I saw a big house at the end of the street . I hoped I would find refuge there. But it was so far away. I awoke as the chase continued, and I was forced to do a circle maneuver.\n",

      "I was in competition with another newspaper for a story. A big story broke, and I was sent to cover it. I was worried about when I should leave for it. It ended up getting dark and I just sort of hung around the parking lot of the newspaper where I interned. I was thirsty, and I went to find water or something. I went home and took a shower. It was one of the houses I lived in when growing up. There was a photojournalist from the newspaper where I work doing a story of Obama or someone like that living in the house. I stepped out of the shower and the photographer was sitting right there on the couch, with a clear view of the hallway. He took a shot of the candidate with me in the frame in a white towel. As I moved to quickly get into my room, I slipped. He took another shot. I grumbled about how they offer no privacy. The journalist, a young girl eager to get a good story, came in to talk to me. I offered some good quotes I cannot remember them as I was trying to fall asleep. She put them in the story, along with pictures. One of the pictures she got was one of me with a skinny black girl, the daughter of someone famous. One was me with my arms wrapped around her. The other was of my chest on her breasts. I had a distressed expression, like I was confiding something to her. The reporter had painted versions of me from the shots. They made it into a This American life photo story that was up for sale. It contained shots of everyone with me in the family business. Third dream. After a long day on the job I went to my small apartment to rest. It was set up like the apartment from the dream where the employees of the newspaper where I interned came to my place. Except this was darker, with no windows. It was built in to the side of a grassy, shaded hill in a residential. type neighborhood near the lifestyle center. Either a puppy or stepbrother was there . I was worried that I'd need to take care of him. Then Sue, the co. worker at my college student newspaper I was attracted to, came in. I did not know it was she. She was working on some sort of protest or big assignment . to get these files that will prove a group of people or animals or something like that was being subjugated to a cruel rule or being bullied or their rights were being infringed on. She said, I've been crying in there for 10 minutes, is how she came out. My hopes flew. Did she break up with him? I asked, Oh, no. how come? It's just wrong what they're doing to them . I have to do something to stop it. I was disappointed, but jumped at the chance to help her with something. No matter what, I'll help you get this done. She began the quest. She was the leader . and a lot of liberal volunteers stepped in to help her. They began by running through the base . there would only be one chance to stop it. There was a great robotic AI cyborg in there. Me, I moved along with the group . unsure what the plan was . but I was going to support them the whole way. I had more attack power and defense than any of them. I got too ahead and lost my way and fell down somewhere and had to re. spawn . to join the group it required one of two crappy pistol. type weapons. I had them, but wondered why you needed loot to join. I thought, as I killed a creature, Is there xp sharing? I thought, no, the level range is too great. I found several of them, including the second in command in an elevatorpuzzle room. There were tiles that supposedly had to be stepped on in a certain order. One of the people had been working and memorizing for hours. I stepped on the tiles and barely made it up to the centerpiece as the girl had her hand on my head. She was supposed to be helping, but she was preventing me from jumping. I knocked her hand off and jumped and stretched and made it up. She was nice enough. As it turned out, just as I thought, it was not an elaborate puzzle at all . it was a lift system power coupling. I pulled the switch and the thing exploded. I jumped out of the way and everyone was ok. We then approached the main gate, where I knew the showdown would take place. we were about to get inside when I woke up.\n",

      "I had a goofy dream last night! I was in a classroom at my high school, in the Media building, working on some sort of test or grammar assignment. There was a lady working with me that I thought I knew, and yet she was not Elizabeth. I felt that she was a substitute teacher assigned to the whole class. The class was working quietly unusual for a sub, and she was working quietly with me, reading me what someone failed to enlarge. I finished early. We both rather implicitly knew that the school had planned to conduct a fire drill that day. Elizabeth used to get the faculty schedule. Time was running out to get to a 'safe place!' I was beginning to get nervous, but not too much. I still had some time to spare. Right about this time, Mom and Dad had planned to pick me up from school and go to Roaring 20s. The substitute teacher said that I needed to take my work to the office as a way of dismissing me in front of the class, but she took my work and put it with the others. I immediately left the classroom and began to head for the main building. I had to maneuver through a lunchtime crowd at both the indoor and outdoor cafeteria spaces. As usual, there were a ton of students loitering everywhere. Once I had made my way past them, I went into the main building. By this time, I was getting quite nervous, but still felt I had time. I ran through the courtyard, but could not run far, just like in life. Before long, I had no more endurance. I walked quickly through the courtyard, past the main office and out through the main entrance. I caught my breath as the heavy doors closed behind me. Sure enough, I went down the steps, and the car was waiting. As soon as I'd climbed in and closed the door, I heard the school's fire alarm sounding faintly in the distance. I had made it in time!! The engine was running, and Dad was in the driver's seat, ready to shift into drive and be off at once. But where was Mom? The sound of the alarm had actually drawn her into the school! I knew that she was in there to show students where to go, and to help keep order. Dad maneuvered slowly to a more appropriate waiting position, off of Third Ave. , and waited for a very short period of time. I kept seeing figures just outside of my passenger. side door, and I kept opening it for them, thinking that they were Mom. Instead, they were only students oogling over the car. I could hear a broom sweeping off the steps of the school, and knew that it was Mom. She had finished attending to the students and would be there soon. But Dad was through waiting. He began to drive away at a normal speed as I protested, explaining how unfair he was being. As I explained myself, Mom somehow appeared in the car beside me she must have jumped in at the first red light! So then we were off to Roaring 20s, and I could not be more excited!! I had escaped my school. girl's nightmare and was on an incredible adventure. But then, we slowly approached an interstate on. ramp probably the Fifth Ave. entrance, and Mom's hand had reached in front of me. She was steadying the shifter. thing on the steering column. It had come lose somehow and they decided that it would not be prudent to go on the Interstate and over the Skyway like that. So, in the next little scene, we were at home, starting out again in the green truck. We were still in our neighborhood, and I began to hear something funny going on with the engine! And then, I woke up!\n",

      "Sue, the co. worker from the college newspaper I was attracted to, was swimming with me. It was a pool party, and there were games. People jumping in, going for a ball, or something like that. I was melancholy about something, she offered advice. We were going camping next, and she helped me set up. Later, I drove to my high school sweetheart Cindy's house on mother's day. I opened the door, went inside, and prepared to be waiting there with some pastries. I chickened out. Ileft, with my dog in the car. Lauren my high school sweetheart Cindy's sister saw me drive away. She came out. She called me. I said I was in the neighborhood and wanted to say hi. She was the first to wake up. I then went to a pool area where I found we'd got a lot of multi. colored geckos, snakes and turtles. My old turtle was hungry . but the food had all been replaced with teeny tiny little turtles. A rainbow gecko had fallen into my turtle's tank; the turtle lunged and swallowed it nearly all the way. I expected the nippy snappy to have cut the thing in half, but it did not. It swallowed it like a snake. But the gecko wriggled free, unscathed. I took it out and set it free. But it bit me multiple times, almost drawing blood. I touched a poison dart frog. Just brushed it. I began to feel strange almost immediately. I tried to feed crickets to some of the critters, but the bag was filled with tiny turtles. My mother came home and went out into the pool area where I was slumped down near a chair or mini bar. I said I'd been bitten by a mamba or something, but had taken the correct anti. venom; I had earlier and had the healing bite mark to prove it on my right arm.\n",

      "I was driving with my mother and a friend to Iraq. We were approaching through Saudi Arabia or another quasi. friendly country. I was tired, so my mother offered to drive. After a moment, I said I'd take over . it would draw more attention if my mother was driving. I was worried they'd find the drugs in the glove compartment if we were stopped . they could have search dogs at the checkpoint. We got in and I went to the beach with my friends Andrew and Nate friends from college. We walked around, saw some cute international girls, and were making jokes about the pings and occasional zips of bullets that zinged past. Everyone started laughing. An Iraqi policeman was making gestures with his gun, like it was making the noises. He had just a small pistol. Then I saw a dark, shrouded terrorist. looking shape in a doorway near a cargo container. I yelled, Officer! Policia ! Look! Terrorist! I pointed, and ran across the fine, dirty sand. Then they all lined up, wearing revolutionary military olive uniforms with Arab squiggles. They charged, I ducked into an alley between shanties. One came sprinting, and I stood in a shadow. I jumped out, tripped him, and began pounding his face with my fists until he was still. As I made the initial lunge, I thought, he's just a punk kid recruited by this shitty demagogue. He's no soldier. That may or may not have been true. Bottom line, I surprised him, and here I was, bashing his face in. Once he was down and out, I had to be sure he'd stay that way. I took off his helmet and dispatched him with it with three blows to his head. I took his gun, and his bandolier. I sprinted down the road to where Barack Obama was doing a book signing with limited security. He wanted to make a statement. I ran up with my gun back and hand forward, palm out and fingers splayed, a gesture of, I mean you no harm. The sage saw this, and told his lone security man to ignore the gun, that I meant them no harm. I told them to get down and take cover. They ducked into a shanty. I told them, and we went out. One was approaching. The gun had come unloaded. It was an M1Garrand, not an AK as I'd expected. I took a clip out of the bandolier and loaded it. It took a moment, but it was simple enough. I held it out and looked down the sights. It was simple enough. But the sights were a little bent. Oh well, I'd make due. I had to go back for Nate and Andrew . before I ran for help, I stood for a moment and thought, god, I cannot just leave them. I began to sprint back, with Barak and a couple of his men behind me. Then they walked toward me; hey! They were released. I let Andrew check out my M. 1.\n",

      "I was skating on roller skates, the old kind. It felt like i was flying. Very rhythmic. Now im in san diego, I went and saw sanna. I was pregnant, I told her I was and kept expecting to go into labor at any moment but did not. I did not appear to be pregnant however. I was in my old loft building which appeared to be somewhat of a commercial building now, I saw Frankie outside looking at my car and I waved but he appeared to be uninterested. Then I was in some store and there were some people there speaking Romanian. Their dad who spoke english was trying to translate ingredients off of a bottle of something, to the kids in Romanian. Everyone, including the dad found this funny. apparently he was just trying to teach them English. Then sanna asked me if i was really pregnant and I said no, I had lied. This made things turn sad. I felt the need to escape. Instead of going out the normal route I asked someone who worked in the building i was in if i could go down the staff elevator because I felt sick and did not want to throw up all over the people in the normal elevator. She hesitated at first and then finally let me take the elevator. During another portion of the dream someone brought up my deceased brother. This made me sad. They asked if i had seen him in the play Brass Knuckles an image appeared of my brother with a blonde afro, like a movie poster. I could seem him in the distance talking to some girl. It was night time and kinda foggy. The person asking me implied that it was a play but must have been asking if I had seen the recorded version of this play since he'd been dead for years.\n",

      "I got sidetracked at a theme park type place where me and my brother Gerald were getting into this race around a track with three other super. fast go karts. The tracks crossed. We were in the lead for most of the time, even going the alternate passing way. But on the last lap, a car turned a corner faster than we did and jetted slightly ahead. But on the final turn, I took it on the inside, and cut just in front. The other car hit us, and we went skittering. It was unclear who won. But then the organizer, Mike Rowe from Dirty Jobs, but with a strange name and more off persona like ChrisAangel, called up the replay . we'd spun just across the line and won. I spoke with him, he gave background, etc. and his strange name. My brother Gerald got his phone number. When I got back to the office to write the story . the office was in the downstairs of one of the houses we once lived in, it appeared, and I had two stories and very limited time. Somewhere earlier there was also a quest for Starbucks in a wet, rainy lifestyle center type place, with a cold ice cream store like the Hagen Daaz we always went to in my home town with the wicker chairs. I forgot to ask him how he came to do what he did, he said Just trying to make a buck. But I wanted to know more. I called him with my brother Gerald's phone, but the number was not working because his carrier was overloaded. I wondered if he put in the number right, but figured he did.\n",

      "206.  lucid  I do not even know where to begin, I am going to write down the basic concept of this dream for it was too long and intense . a recurring dream with new parts added. Started out I was being held captive by Dracula. I had escaped from him many times and had watched him kill others. He desired me most because I got away. Then Jon was there and he was creepy, he had me pinned down to the ground saying perverted things. He was wearing a gold chain around his neck, that was all. I think I was in a red dress. Then I started to bleed because I got my period. Then Jon told me to come back  I was leaving for I had to run from this evil, then he grabbed me and started to 'go down' on me. I realized he was a vampire too and wanted to kill me. Hazy. At this point we are in this hilly area with lots of trees and people and Dracula opened up taco restaurants in the corresponding locations in this land that everyone was going to. When you got there, you had your picture taken with him on top of a slide. This I get forced to do. I am in line to get to the steps thinking of ways to get out of the situation. When I do get to the top he is gone, so people are trying to get me to slide down the slide is huge and very wide, a deep red color. I ended up going down and escaping and running to the end of the building, getting outside to see a group of black guys. They told me I look like I work hard. I explain, 'Guys, you have to help me. We have to run now!!' We are all by dumpsters. We all start running like crazy. Then all of a sudden I am coming out of a door and it was the front door to Richard's house and he is outside in the circle drive with his jeep. I tell him to stop and get in. I jump into his car that has no doors and some other guy does also,that I do not know. So I am telling him to go. He speed up like drivng on the highway getting ready to merge with other cars. All of a sudden the roads got tiny and slick and turning in ways you could not drive. His car falls off a few times. Hazy. Now I have a team of people running with me and we are in a lightly wooded area running downhill dogging rocks, then people start to fall and roll down this hill. Everyone is yelling 'tree' so we do not run into it. Someone got their head stuck in a tree branch and it turned giant. Then I was in a spot with another girl; she is hanging from a branch about 4 feet above. She is scared and I tell her to jump. Then we start running and we get into all these gray concrete tubes in the middle of a field and at this point it was overcast outside, then we get into this white truck. We know we will be safe here. We get in the back and smoke this herb that is nice, she had it rolled up in a tiny paper. We hear the others come so we start to run. As I am looking down I see all these tiny black snakes and am dodging them, then at this point I realize that I am dreaming, but not on a conscious level. It was just part of the dream. Then we are at a furniture store and we go to get Colton to join our team. At first he says no and I am taking a knife to a foot and rip it open just because I can because I am dreaming. Then I try and turn a stack of VHS tapes into toads. Colton says no because he has studying to do on the Bible. But we convince him to come. He grabs this red velvet jacket type thing. We type in serial numbers into a database in case he dies they can identify him. We start to run again, then all of a sudden we are crawling underneath a deck type thing in a yard. First we watch three little girls crawl underneath it while they were singing 'London bridges falling down,' so we start to crawl and it gets smaller. At one point we made it to the other end at this point it was daytime. It was a garden type place, there was a big washing machine type thing in the middle, more like a giant bowl, and it was filled with water. I was listening to two ladies talk by it. One was saying to the other that she could not use the water in there for when it rained it dried in there and contaminated the water now. She was rude. The other woman replied, of that I cannot remember.\n",

      "I am with Eugene K. Kolp, the lawyer with whom I made the will. I am in his office. I have some sort of box reminds me a little of a FedX box, in which I have the papers and documents and some small keys, I am trying to arrange for how, in the event of my death, the will would be found by the people in my family I am looking, for example, for a small key that would open the drawer, and ask or say to Eugene something like, 'I'll put the will in my desk drawer, and I'll give you the key to the desk drawer', and so forth. But I am very unorganized, I have, in the box, papers that are very unorganized and all over the place, various miscellaneous small keys, and so forth. We are in a large room like the room we were in when I met with him in waking life to make my will. Only this time the room is a little bigger, and I am sitting a bit further from him, and I have a sense that there might be other people other lawyers who need the room after we are finished. Something about the situation or atmosphere also reminds me a little of Bernabei  Katz. As we are sitting here, I have an observing ego part of myself that sees how messy and unorganized I am, and that sees, at some level, how there could very well be a scenario in which I end up dying and nobody ever knows about or finds the will, and my mother ends up spending the money on or giving the money to other people, for example, my brother and Elizabeth, rather than Janie and the people and charities I designated in my will. When I think of that, here, now, in Eugene's office, I have almost a sense of bemusement about it, a kind of quiet resigned good. humored wry acceptance of it, almost like the attitude of John Jarndyce about the Jarndyce  Jarndyce lawsuit in the novel Bleak House. Then, there's a shift I suddenly see that this could be the plot of a novel. I see how the situationscenario could play out as a plot. and how it could be a really good novel, and I could write it. I think it also has scenes from Sierra Leone I get excited about this idea, and I want to tell Eugene about it. kind of reminds me of how, at the end of the Jarndyce  Jarndyce lawsuit, the lawyers and many others are kind of chuckling about it, in a kind of humored way, as if they are humored by it, even though from another perspective and to some people it's actually quite serious Now, I am more excited about telling Eugene my idea for the plot of my novel than I am text trails off than to focus on the meeting with Eugene and the indeciph. word or the papers and keys. I start to tell Eugene about the idea of the novel, but he is focused on wanting to finish making arrangements about the will, I think there's some time pressure because someone else needs the room it reminds me a little of the offices of that lawyer who did disability law, where I'd been referred by Lou Steele. I am like chatting away, about how I have an idea, an idea, and Eugene is trying to focus on the concrete task of completing what we need to complete so that the will will be taken care of and three indeciph. words, probably 'make sure that' people would know how to find it. I think he then says to me something like, that in a few minutes they will need the room, or something like that. Another lawyer says to me, 'can you put that stack of papers outside', and I think he's joking, i. e. , like why would I put these important papers out. of. doors outside is not merely out of this room within the same building, it is outside outside like down 1 stepreminds me a little of the area behind the sliding glass doors in Wayland. But he is serious, he says something like, he has another client coming and he needs for the papers to be outside so that when his meeting with this client starts these papers indeciph. two words will be out of the room So, there is some pressure and some haste. And it's like, Eugene indeciph. the room. Feels like it's important that we indeciph about how people will find my will in the event of my death, and suddenly now I feel it's important to tell him the plot for my novel. that shift occurred, I think, just when the other lawyer told me I had to put my papers outside and I realized that he was serious, i. e. , put them outside out. of. doors and not just outside of the room. When our time is up, Eugene and I go outside, and we start to walk. and while we are walking, I am telling himor trying to tell himthe plot for my novel. The dynamic is like, I'm trying to tell him about the plot for my novel and get him to listen to and focus on that, in its entirety, and he is trying to get me to focus on taking care of my will so that in the event of my death my will would be foundi. e. , it's like I see that I indeciph for an interesting novel, the plot indeciph that the will is not found, at least, not initially. I think that Mariama is in the plot, and Janie. The plot, as I am walking and trying to tell it to Eugene Kokut, is something like I make the will, leaving everything to Janie, but I do not put the will in a place where people would be likely to find it, it is like buried in other papers or in someone else's hands, maybe Eugene's maybe Lila Coleburn's I think she might be in the plot too Then I die, suddenly, I think in an auto accident, something about that reminds me of Sierra Leone, like when I was driving the 4. wheel. drive vehicle, like an accident like the accident at the side of Naeem's wall and my mother, possibly also with my brother and his wife I think that my brother is the villain in the storythe deliberate villain, whereas my mother is kind of unwittingly, blindly, unintentionally participating in the will not being found, vs. deliberately not implementing it It's like, somehow since they cannot find a will, when I die, my mother does not know about the existence of the will or the existence of Eugene Kokut or the existence of Janie or that I specifically deliberately left my niece out of my will because I wanted my money to go to Janie, not my niece andor nephew, but my mother assumes that I would have wanted my money to go to Elizabeth She my mother is like, essentially, a character who thinks she knows her daughter but who does not really know her daughter, from whom enormous spheres of who her daughter is and what her daughter's life is about are not known or visible like a theme about a mother's blindness, obliviousness, unawareness, regarding who her daughter is and what her daughter's life has been all about, whereas my brother is a character who does know about the existence of the will and where the will is but deliberately withholds that information so that his daughter and son will get the money and in so doing, he is not only betraying my memory but he is also betraying his own mother, because our mother would want to know the truth if she could, she would not want to remain blind, because her love for me and desire to be true to my memory exceeds her desire to have the money go to Elizabeth and Jonathan, but my brother cares more about having the money go to Elizabeth and Jonathan and being able to hurt me after my death than he cares about my mother. My sister. in. law is somewhere in between all thisI think that she starts out being on Mark's side, or possibly being blind to the reality like my mother, but then gradually, over time, she does evolve and become more compassionate and softened less rigid and uncaring toward both my memory as her sister. in. law and toward Janie as the child who stands to benefit if the correct will is found. There is some kind of process, almost like in a mystery or detective novel or treasure hunt, some kind of process of finding the will andor finding out about the existence of the will. I think part of that takes place in Sierra Leone, like in Graham Greene's The Heart of the Matter, it's possible that one of the characters, maybe my sister. in. law, goes to Sierra Leone to search for the truth the sister. in. law character is the one with, like, the moral dilemmabasically, she has to choose between what is right and being selfish i. e. , she has to choose between, essentially, her own daughter Elizabeth and Janie, and in the end, she does so she grows morally or shows herself to be morally doorbell rings, in waking life, with package, after which I again close my eyes and return to the hypnagogic state and process of remembering the dream i. e. , she either grows, or, alternatively, she shows herself, when indeciph. two words, maybe 'she is uncovered', and time goes by, to have a moral stature or integrity that was not at all evident, or else, she grows as time goes byI think she encounters Mariama along the way, and something about the encounter with Mariama transforms her or affects her and the Janie character is somehow like Esther Summerson, in the sense that in the end, even though she suffered a lot along the way, and even though she started out as an orphan or in poverty, in the end she inherits everything all the wealth and estate of me or the character based on me in the novel and it's like that kind of ending of Bleak House where text trails off butas an alternative endingbecause indeciph the reader has a choice between two endings kind of like in Villette in the alternate ending, it is more like at the end of 100 Years of Solitude, when all the important papers and documents are simply eaten by ants, and no. one ever knows about their existence, in the alternate ending, no one ever finds the will, and Janie never knows about it and just lives her life in Sierra Leone, oblivious, and the real truth of the will and who the money was supposed to go to and the existence of the will and where I placed it or where it was, never comes to light. And like in 'The Professor's House' by Willa Cather, there is like a novel within the novel which is the story of the telling to the lawyer of the story of the dream. It's something like, that, I am taking this long walk with Eugene, during which I am telling him the entire plot of my proposed novel, and that is the noveli. e. , my telling Eugene the plot of the novel is the main part of the novel, in which the plot of the novel itself is seen or known by the reader but the novel really begins with my meeting with Eugene Kokut almost like the way that The Wizard of Oz actually takes place as a dream, i. e. most of the plot is Dorothy's dream, but before that plotdream, and after that plotdream, there is the part about being in Kansas with her family, the tornado happens, then being back in Kansas with her family, it is similar to that, it's like, I am with Eugene, in his law office, to discuss the question of how people would find my will in the event of my death, and then we are forced to go out of Eugene's office, so we, Eugene and I, are taking a walk, and in the course of that walk I am telling Eugene the entire plot of my novel, which thus allows the reader to read the whole plot i. e. about Janie, my mother, Mark, Sherri, Mariama, Sierra Leone, the car accident, etc. but then, there's another layer tooan additional layer of richness and complexitywhich involves Lilaand the dreamthis dreami. e. , it is something likethat I go to therapy, to a therapy session, with Lila, and during the therapy session, I tell Lila about the dreamthis dream So, in the context of telling her about this dream, I tell her about the meeting with Eugene Kokut at the law offices and about how, when Eugene and I were taking a walk after meeting in his law office, I tell him all about my proposed plot for my novel but this is still all taking place inside my dream, which I am telling Lila about in my therapy and then, there's two different possibilities, i. e. , two different possible endings. In oneI tell all this to Lila, and she tells me I need to really write this novel, that this is a real novel that I need to now go and write, and I do so, and I am successful at it, the novel is good and receives critical acclaim, and it's like, a happy ending that kind of parallels the happy ending for Janie in which at midlife I write a successful, well. received novel, even though in the years before I suffered a lot and lost a lot and was abused by my brother and so forth. That is one possible ending. In the other possible ending, after I tell this dream to Lila, with all of these layers and all this complexity, I really do die, and Lila is now the one who is left with all this knowledge two indeciph. words, Lila is now essentially the character in the novel who possesses all the secret knowledge almost like an omniscient character and now it is Lila who is faced with the moral dilemma of whether to continue her life as it is, with her comfortable therapy private practice on the Upper West Side, just deny the knowledge she has about my will and Janie and how Janie was supposed to be the one who inherited my money, not my niece and nephew, or she decides to show integrity and moral stature in this she kind of parallels the character of my sister. in. lawwho has a comfortable life and has to make a decision about whether to sacrifice a degree of comfort in order to do what is right and grow morally or have moral integrity SheLilahas to decide whether to continue in her private practice as is, or to get involved in the plot, get involved in bringing the whole novel to lighti. e. two indeciph. words she is the one who has to choose whether to write the novel, because, after all, I have died so I cannot do it myself, and she has to decide whether to go to Sierra Leone and find Janie kind of like the way I imagined Denise having to do, in the event of my death, given how unreliable and unworkable the telephones are in Sierra Leone, and in any event given the risk that the money for Janie could be taken and used by Janie's father, for example for alcohol, if one is not careful about making sure that it really goes to Janie there is a sense that Lila, too, encounters Mariama, and through the encounter with Mariama, she is somehow changed or maybe Mariama might be the parallel character to my motherbut Mariama is one whowell, not parallels, but complementsMariama is the complement to my motheror something like that Mariama is poor, little. known, but knows me deeply and well, my motherwealthy, known, but does not know me I think maybe they need to encounter each other at some point anywayLila has to decidei. e. in a moral choice. point or moral dilemmain the novelabout whether to step in to the plot and thereby prevent all the characters from being doomed to obscurity and Janie from never receiving what is her due, or to continue text trails off So, with this additional layer, it's like, I go to therapya session with Lila 1 In the therapy session, I tell Lila about my meeting with Eugene Kokut to discuss my will 2 In my meeting with Eugene Kokut to discuss my will, I tell him, while we are walking, about the proposed plot for my novel. 3 The proposed plot is that indeciph. word story about me dying suddenly, my will never being known about or found, and my money being given to my niece and nephew which makes my brother and Sherry happy but which is precisely what I stipulated in my will should not happen, Eugene and my brother are indeciph. word juxtaposedas two male lawyers is my stepfather in this somewhere? Like Sir Leicester? and then, within that part, there are two different endings in one ending, the truth is discovered and the will is found and Janie does inherit my money and the moral order is restored and everything turns out right; in the other ending, the truth is never discovered though it is known by Markhe is like a Tulkinghorn character here and Janie goes on living her life in Sierra Leone never knowing that she was meant to be an heiress and have a different, better life, and the truth of my having made the will and notarized it with Eugene Kokut and thought in advance about the prospect of my death and how I needed to provide for Janie in the event of my death never comes to light in a sense, I might be like the Lady Dedlock character, who seems to be uncaring but who at deeper layers was capable of immense compassion and caring but nobody ever know it for example, in Bleak House, it is never discovered by most of the characters how loving and tender were Lady Dedlock's feelings for Esther the parallel to Lila's character is the literature professor, with whom I or she discusses all this at some point i. e. , Ben Taylor and the point on which everything hinges the crucial point which determines how it will all turn out, which way it will goi. e. , the lynchpin on which everything hinges is the moral decision. making of Lila, the therapist character in a sense, even with all the characters, she is really the main character in the story because all of this is known to her she is almost omniscient whereas the other characters each only have a part of the storyeach have partial knowledge but partial, of varying degrees, obliviousness or blindness She has the knowledge, and the question is What will her decision be? Will she rise to the occasion, leave behind what is comfortable, and go to Sierra Leone to find Janie and Eugene and the will and bring all of this to light, or will she just let all of thisthis story, my story, my novel fall into obscurity and never go further than the therapy consulting room. And it's like, what this hinges on, the only way this can happen, is if Lila becomes a writer, a novelist it's like, Lila has to write this novel, because she is the only one who has all the parts of it and all the information about it, because I have told it to her in my therapy session, or it will simply never be written, because I have already died but I have also written it too, to some extent, because I have given her the text and the characters and the settings and many of the details, and she has to decide whether to let it fall into oblivion or whether to write it and bring it to lightshe is really, in a sense, the moral center of the novel. And I think at one point, she may consult with my literature professor, Ben Taylor, about how, or whether, to do thisso there's an encounter that's meaningful for her which has to do with her own life, and her own history, and her father, like, in the photo I saw of her at Tufts University when I saw that her major was literature English, i. e. , another layer is that it also reminds her of her own love of literature which she suppressed or buried for many years while she worked first as a lawyer and then as a therapist, and the writer part of herself. So there is also a kind of parallel between Lila and Janie in the sense that, asking the question of will she become a writer, as she has the potential to be and perhaps was meant to be, or will not she? And what does this hinge on? and it hinges mainly on people'sspecific people's moral stature and moral decision. making there is a kind of existential moment in which she has to decide whether she is going to be a writer or not. which parallels my own and the character who represents me's process of trying to decide whether to become a writer or not, whether to write my novel or not. One of the things that I want the readers who read this novel to take from it, is they need to put their affairs in order and make their own will and make sure that somebody knows where their will is, they need to know that anything can happen and they can die at any moment, they need to feel a kind of 'jolt' of self. recognition, after reading the novel, whatever else they may have gained from the novel or however much they may or may not have enjoyed reading the novel, they actually in waking life decidemany of themafter reading my novelthat they will go see their lawyer and make a will and make sure that the instructions in their will and about how to find their will are clear it's like, I want the novel to have a real impact on the reader in a parallel sense, the reader too in a sense has a moral dilemma or an opportunity to make a morally correct choice or to let it fall by the wayside, to contact his or her lawyer and make a will and put his or her affairs in their proper order, with clear instructions, or not something kind of like in that story about Scroogeor something like thatafter you read about Scrooge at Christmastime, or after you watch 'The Grinch Who Stole Christmas' on TV, you are not supposed to remain unmoved or stay exactly the way you were before, you are supposed to then actually behave in a more generous or moral way, because of what you've readlike, I want my readers to go out, after reading the novel, and put their affairs in order and be more aware of their own mortality. And as one more layerone final layerI might also put the readeror a readerinto the novel itself i. e. , after all these other layers like the way there is the plot within the plot, in Willa Cather's The Professor's Housethe story about Tom I will put a reader in the novel, who reads the novel, and is changed by itwho then goes out and makes an appointment with his lawyer and makes sure that he has been clear about what to do in the event of his death. there might also be something about the literature professor, he comes to learn of this plot, and he borrows part of it or plans to publish part of it, as his own work, and Lila goes to him and tries to make him see the fact that it's my plot not his has to be respected and honored so, she has the moral correctness to persuade him of this, i. e. , to be true to my memory this parallels the decision by my brother in the opposite direction i. e. my brother was deliberately untrue to my memory, my literature professor is persuaded by Lila to be true to my memory in spite of the temptation not to but again, it all hinges on Lila, because Lila is the one who goes to see him and persuades him of that. So, there is this encounter between Lila and the literature professor. And Lila is the parallel to Janie, Lila is like how Janie could be if she had the opportunity to realize her potential. I want to call this novel 'The Will', and it is, although being truly about my will i. e. my last will and testament, also a play on words because it is also about the human will more generally what you will, and whatever indeciph. word you will to happen, is actually what happens, it's also about five indeciph. words and about people's will in the sense of greed and selfishness like the Mark character or people's will in terms of fierce moral commitment like the Lila character, in the end and at some level also hints at something, subliminally, related to Nietzsche's will to power or will to something else I cannot remember. and also it's about the limits of our will, which are related largely to our mortality, i. e. , the idea that after we die, we cannot do anything any more to really make sure that our will i. e. what we want to have happen and what we want to make happenwill actually happen, once we are gone, we cannot do anything about it, and it mainly depends on the will of othersthe moral willto carry out the will or to do what is right ideas like 'iron will' vs. 'they will be done' Lord's prayer and the way many people try to implement their will in an iron. like way sometimes because underneath it all they are afraid of their mortality and of the real helplessness and powerlessness they have to influence the course of events once they are gone Lenora Helmsly comes to mind So the title, 'The Will' has many connotations and many meanings. something about obscuritybeing doomed to obscurityvs. coming out into the light seeing the light of day emerging the truth being known and recognizedor the truth about people being known and recognized.\n",

      "214. 1 I found some sort of map and followed it alone. I reached a certain part where I should have turned around and gone back but I kept going. On these trails were dirt paths surrounded by tall pine trees. I remember simply walking on them feeling happy and peaceful. Then as I stopped to rest, a brown bear came up to me and Hoot was all of a sudden there. I was holding her back so she would not get hurt. Then it came straight up to my face. I was not scared at all. Then it just wandered off. So I want to go on the path but it says keep out because of bears. I decide to go anyway. The path became narrow and a more dense surrounding forest area. Then I stumble upon a group of people taking a tour, on a wooden bridge type path thing. Some I know, some I do not. Then I start to floatfly up. Then I start to explain to the group that they can do it too. I think they did not believe me. Hazy. Then I see Justin and he shows me a bear's nest. Next thing I remember I was driving alone at night on the highway, then normal traffic streets. I was confused in what to do.

      "I dreamed that Barack Obama was my father. I'd never felt so awe. struck around any man before in my life. It was as if he was on tour. He came to visit me in Thailand. I met him and his large limo. We visited a school. He was spouting wisdom with every step. I felt energized and exhilarated just being in his presence. I felt like I was somehow a better man to be in his entourage. I did not want any special treatment, being around him. But from the jaw. drop reactions, the paralyzed stares as we walked around, it was hard not to feel special. Before we went to the school, we stopped at a gas stationclothing store. Obama jumped in with fervor, selecting acceptable, but still down to earth and local clothes. He pulled out one coat, a pair of slacks, and folded them over his arm. Who cares if I thought the clothes were a bit off. He's the president, and more than that, he is who he is. His clothes would work either way. While he was meticulously selecting his wardrobe for his Asia tour to look more local, and to contribute to the local workers, I sat with Jasmine, who met me at the garage. I told her, Barack Obama is my father. She said she did not know who that was. Inside, I was incredulous. I was embarrassed and I liked her a whole lot less. She followed with us the rest of the trip, and I felt ashamed in front of Obama to have her along. At least she knows who Britney Spears is. I walk alongside him. He's tall, almost like a lanky giant. Taller than most men. And we go to a classroom. There, he talks to the students, but says to me, son, let's walk. Tell me about your school, your plans. I felt embarrassed telling him my petty aspirations. I'm writing a book. He's written two. I'm going to write for a new newspaper, which writes about him every day. He sounds impressed. I tell him about adventures sneaking into a dorm. We are on a campus, after all. He does not seem to get it. Maybe I'm not explaining it right. We go back after circling the campus. He mixes up the state's main public university with one of the other state universities. I tell him that's like calling a boy a girl. He has a test now. He leaves and comes back two minutes later with a box. Inside are a few sheets of white paper with instructions handwritten. We'd need to find our way to a point, then watch for a splash of a pebble in the water, then get the pebble out . or something to that affect. The other boy playing along . they dive in and randomly search for the rock, shaped like a mitten hand, until they come up with one . but it's the wrong one. They did not follow instructions. He is quiet along the bank, runs up and throws the right rock then hides among the muddy weeds. Can he do that? Did not they see him? I guess not. He took a gamble. And are not there massive crocodiles in this lake? Could not the boys get hurt? I found a lot of things wrong or risky in the things he did. But he's Obama, it does not matter.\n",

      "I had a crazy dream the night before last. I was at church with the band. We were practicing, and the stage was twice as crowded and narrow as it normally is. In real life, I've stopped climbing on from the front. Instead, I go to the steps on the left side to avoid all the mic stands, music stands, cables and amps, and go straight for the keyboard, and my chair to the side. In this dream, there were steps on the right, and I had to traverse the entire stage in order to get too the keyboard. I kept running into big obstacles that impeded my movement and travel. Then, I was sitting down in the congregation seats where all of us sit while Emmett is giving his sermon. There was a beautiful grand piano in the corner where our upright usually is. A guest performer, a man in a suit, was playing a fantastic, virtuosic, improvised arrangement of 'From a Distance', the kind that I would want to play someday. I kept hearing these timpani. like soundsat key points in the song that really sounded like timpani. As it turned out, the man told us that he was popping balloons in order to make that sound!! He had a little cluster of balloons hanging above him at the piano. I wondered how on earth could you pop balloons while your hands are busy playing the piano, and second of all, I really did not want anybody popping balloons because I hate that sound. For this reason, I was always rather afraid of balloons as a child. As I began to awaken, I realized that the sound of a balloon popping sounds nothing at all like a set of timpani!!\n",

      "I'd been invited to exhibit some work at an outdoor group exhibition in another country. The man who invited me was a friend of myfather who was in marketing but in the dream he's an artist. The exhibition was set along a rural track . perhaps in a park on farmland. Huge billboards have been constructed containing photographic prints and some hold light. boxes. There are also some interior space. like constructions. There are many other exhibitors this place is huge, and there are hundreds of people here to see it. The people seem to be driving along the track past the exhibits. I'm not sure which country we're in . maybe somewhere in eastern europe. The man who invited me has work up here . his work is large conceptual photographs of rural or industrial scenes . quite banal, for example like a shot of a grass verge next to a motorway. He has many pieces on display . I only have a few. But apparently there is a man who wants to meet me to discuss my work. This guy is waiting for me with his wife and children . and apparently so I'm told he is one of the only people alive today who is 90 mexican. I drive the other guys car down the track to the other end of the exhibition. The car is attached to a large, high trailer . like a cage . containing 20 or 30 pictures in frames.

As I was walking out on the driveway, there were a lot of cars parked because Nate was having a party. Then a car pulled up that was Derick Johnston and Nathan Fredrick from Pershing Middle School. We said our hellos and left. I started to drive and I decided that I wanted to take the highway home. But along the way, I kept getting turned around. So I went and parked across the street and left my car for some reason. As I was coming back, my car had changed to a slug bug and someone was putting in gas and fixing it. Then I followed the person to a little building next door. There were about 10. 12 people, girls and boys. This was a building where poor people could come and learn something along those lines. They would sit in a circle and play instruments. Then at one point I remember painting on a refrigerator. Hazy.\n",

      "223. I go downstairs to smoke with the neighbor boys and I told Towah about the play, but as time went on I felt really messed up, like, I could hardly keep my eyes open. Justin went down there too. As I was leaving, Justin was getting ice for the freezer as I was going up the steps. I went back into the apartment. I was confused. So I took the other stairs and found my way home. I went in and there were people there printing off something the leasing office had a printer that was in a closet over our front door. People would go in and out to use it. Then I was a little boy walking down Walnut St. and a big van stopped. It almost hit me. Then the man kidnapped me. We drove to this amusement type place that had cars you could rent, that you could go driving through the woods and around. Then man then dropped us and the van off here, where he got out boxes of shoes and we traded. I had some scheme in my head to do to him, what I cannot remember. So I put on different shoes and the next thing I remember is being the man now. And I am driving my car. The woman working there told me not to take the route with animals, so I do not, but the other one. I start driving. The path had snow and ice, then it had calm flowing water. I drove through. There were many spots like this, then I start to go up a really steep hill. But I cannot make it all the way to the top. The car would not there were two kids playing at the top, so I the man get out of the car and start to rapidly fall down the hill. I tried to grab on to the side. This did not save me. I fell into the woods. Hazy. I do not know who, what, when, where, why, but I ended up going to the water park with Janell J. as my date. She pretended to be my girlfriend for me because Jon was there with Amanda, and the most random person, Carlton from a TV show. During this time we would go down waterslides all of this was indoor with parking garages around whenever we saw Jon, she would start to make out with me and call me girlfriend. Then we saw Matt and did the same. I remember at one point looking down at the people from a ledgebalcony. I was mean to Jon and called him an asshole. But then apologized. It did not matter. He was still bitter towards me. Then the park was closing, Janell and I went into a closet with cobwebs in the right corner and a picture that we put there a long time ago. It was like dj vu in the dream, then we were going through her purse that had so much paper in it. The next thing I was driving a van alone on Walnut Street on the corner of National. It was at night and they had shut down traffic. Everyone was crazy and getting out of their cars. I saw Andy M. walking by. I cannot remember the exact reason but it was something with Jesus, he was on the cross, or he would not come out. I do not know, some drama with Jesus. Hazy. I am traveling through the woods and once again get held up by Jesus. They were doing something and I had to get out of the way or I would have been killed.

      "a baby about 12 months old. looks like Jennifer when she was around 3 What happened is I had to go somewhere in a car. It seemed like a fairly ordinary day; even, perhaps, a bad day because there was a problem with my car, Then I arrive at work I have a relatively new job, in a hospital, I think it's in or near New York or 'Newark', relatively In the hospital, I stop by the area where there are boarder babies, or babies among whom 1 or 2 might be boarder babies. I talk with the nurses there, who are my colleagues now since I too am working in this hospital, they mention to me one abandoned baby, and then one of them mentions something like, 'and there might be a second one, too', meaning, a second baby whom no. one has claimed, she has just been left here to languish. I do not take that much note of what she is saying. but then, shortly thereafter, I see a baby toward whom I feel deeply drawn. I lift her up I take her in my arms. She seems to naturally and intuitively trust me. There is an immediate feeling of connection and of our belonging together and knowing one another, as if we have known each other before. Till now, the baby has been silent. She has not appeared to have knowledge of or access to speech. And she has been kind of hiding behind a piece of cloth that reminds me a little of a Muslim head. scarf. After I pick her up take her in my arms, and begin to walk around the wardunit with her in my arms, it becomes clear to me that she understands speechfar more than she had initially let onand that she, also, is able to speakmore than one would expect for a baby her age i. e. , beyond the level of a 12. month. old. As I continue walking with her in my arms, for some reasonI am not sure whyI bring her with me in a car, it's either my car or a car I have rented, I drive somewhere. I park the car. I get out of the car with her. It is some kind of restaurant or area of restaurants. I am thinking to get something to eat, either for her, me, or both of us. Then, somehow, when I step out of the area of the restaurants, I end up in an apartment, where Anastasia lives, apparently Anastastia lives here. I enter. As I am spending some time talking with Anastasia while also holding the baby in my arms, I observe that Anastasia has a friend with hera woman who seems to be around 16, 16 to 22 years old or so, and as they are talking, I start to realizeto my astonishmentthat this woman has a baby at the same hospital and same unit from which I took this Jennifer baby and that it appears, in fact, that this baby is her biological baby. I recognize that the odds of my ending up here like thisstumbling upon the place where her biological mother happens to bewere incredibly thin. For a moment, I feel embarrassed, as if I am going to get in trouble for having taken the baby. But then, I decide to deal with the situation in a matter. of. fact way. I mention that I would like to adopt this baby, if she will grant her permission. She indicates that she will give the matter some serious thought. Meanwhile, as we continue to spend time in this apartment, I observe several things about her biological mother Anastasia's friend that lead me to think that the baby might indeed have qualities that make her very well. matched with me. For example, I observe that Anastasia's friend seems to be politically left. wing, i. e. , interested in issues of human rights, etc. Also, I observe that there are some CDs scattered about and it becomes clear that Anastasia's friend is into musicboth listening to music, and singingshe seems to have a love of music. I also get the impression that she is intelligent. I would like to know more about her, but I get the impression that it would be, at this point at least, presumptuous of me to ask i. e. , since she has not even decided yet whether she will permit me to adopt her. I also observe that she is a friend of Anastasia's, and that increases my feelings of respect for her. At the same time, I also become aware that this woman, for whatever reason or combination of reasons, has not been able to be a good enough mother to this baby. The baby apparently has a few wounds something like black. and. blue marks one might be behind her ear that are the result of her biological mother having physically abused her, probably during moments of carelessness. And also, there is evidence that she the baby has been neglected by her biological mother. For example, she was apparently left at the hospital unit for boarder babies her biological mother left her there without coming to visit her or seeming to really care much about how she is faring or what is going on with her. I have the sense that it is not that her biological mother is a bad person but just that, for whatever reason, she has not been able to feel a deep sense of love for and caring about this baby. Partly because she is immature I think she is a teenage mother, partly because she has problems of her own i. e. , from how her own mother behaved withtoward her, and partly because it seems that she has, now, a younger baby, an infant, maybe just a few months old, who is taking up a lot of her time and attention, so, she is overwhelmed and stretched beyond her resources, and that is another reason that she cannot focus on this baby who is molded against me; it seems that even though she said 'I will think about it', my sense is that the idea of letting me adopt her child is growing on her and that she is probably moving in the direction of saying yes. Another thingwhen we were talking a few minute earlierit becomes clear to me, through her connection with Anastasia and some other evidence, toothat this woman the biological mother has some type of connection to Africato West Africa, I think. So, in order to show the biological mother that I can understand and respect this aspect of her daughter's heritage, I say something like, 'And I have a strong connection to Africa. I spent over 3 years in West Africa. I have a strong feeling for the African continent. I would be able to raise her to appreciate and honor the African part of her identity. ' I think that this, too, influences the mother toward allowing me to adopt her. Meanwhile, as all this conversation and visit to this apartment is going on, I continue to feel more and more connection with the child and her with me. It is obvious at least to the child and me that a bond is developing between us, that is a mother. childchild. mother type of bond. And that the child wants and needs that. At the same time, I also get the sense that becoming this child's mother might be more difficult and challenging than I have admitted sort of like with the Gilders, with Jennifer. Partly because, obviously, with this early history of abuse and neglect, lasting about 12 months, the child will definitely carry some psychological scars, and these scars can manifest in some problematic angry, etc. behavior, especially as she becomes a teenager. Secondly, it becomes clear to me from general impressions as well as a gesture that the baby makes at one point . I think she sticks her foot into my crotch, pressing it therethat almost certainly, this suffered child sexual abuse at an early age. And I imagine that as a result of this childhood sexual abuse, the baby is going to have some issues or challenges related to appropriate sexual behavior for example, not engaging in casual or early sex as she enters her teenage years. i. e. , she would engage in these behaviors as a way of repeating or 'processing' her trauma, because she has not really processed it at the verbalsymbolic level. And I think about how having two indeciph. words could be challenging and difficult for me. I do have some two indeciph. words that becoming this child's mother could be difficult and complicated in many ways. I also think about the fact that text trails off I also have some concerns and discomfort about the fact that this child has blonde hair and blue eyes and does not look Jewish or Eastern Europeanshe looks like a child from a totally different ethnic background from me. And I'd always wanted a child with that ethnic Jewish Eastern European lookdark hair, dark eyes, medium skin. tone, etc. And this child looks foreign to thatshe is light. skinned, blonde hair thin hair, blue eyes, etc. So, I have some reservations about that. But whatever reservations I may have, it is clear, in spite of it all, that the child and I are bonding, that there is a mysterious and powerful bond between us. And it appears that we need to be together. So, where it stands, for the moment, is that the biological mother will think about letting me adopt her. And I am starting to think about all the logistical challenges and logistical hurdles. Then, it occurs to me that I need to get back to the hospital unit with the babythat if I don't, and they notice the baby missing, or they realize that I have taken the baby off the premises for several hours without signing her out or informing anyone of what I am doing, I could be charged with kidnapping or at the very least would almost certainly lose my job at the hospital, they would pathologize me i. e. , view me as in some way not okay, there is no way they would understand the complexities or the powerful mutual relationship bond between me and the baby; they would only look at it as, I did something weird, inexplicable, indeciph. word, I picked up one of the boarder babies and wandered off with her indeciph. words and took her off the premises for several hours. So, I really want to get back to the hospital unit without anyone there indeciph. word, probably with a meaning like 'realizes' or 'discovers' that we the baby and I have been of. site for several hours and have gone in a car. The baby understands the importance of this. She understands the importance of not revealing or disclosing where we have been and for how long. We go out from the apartment during this whole time, the baby has still been in my arms, molded against my body and search for where I parked my car. We go back through the restaurant and try to retrace our steps, etc. but I cannot find the car. I realize that we really cannot lose more time looking for it. Then I get the idea of our taking a taxi. I hail a taxi one appears in our path just at that moment, we get in the taxithere is no car. seat for babies so the driver asks me to sit in front and hold the baby in my arms, carefully. We reach the hospital. I give the driver 10 and tell him to keep the change partly to save time and partly so if, later, anyone asks if anyone has seen anyone with the baby he will be less likely to report us. The baby is still molded to me reminds me of that silver statue I have at home, of mother and child. Although I am really scared we will get caught entering the hospital, it occurs to me that given my age and the way the baby is molded against me, I probably look like any ordinary mother and will not likely arouse much suspicion. Once we get inside the hospital, although I am still nervous, I feel a large amount of relief, because it occurs to me that if anyone catches us now, at this point, they will have no idea that we were actually off. premises, and I can just say that I've been walking around the hospital wards with the baby, inside the building, just to give her a chance to move around and be outside of the small hospital unit where she was. As we go back onto the ward, it becomes clear to me that nobody realizes that we were gonenobody noticedand I can breathe a sigh of relief as can the baby, because we have not been caught leaving the premises. Now, where it stands is, that although I have to put the baby back here for now and it will appear as if she is still 'just' a boarder baby, neglected, unloved, without much of a future, the baby and I have now bonded and made a commitment to each other and she and I both now know that we will be together. And that makes it much easier for the baby to bear the rest of the time that she has to remain in this place hospital unit, i. e. , because she knows that eventually, she will get out of here and be with me. She now has hopeshe knows she will get out of here. And even though I have to let her be back in this place for now, I know I am going to visit her every day and somehow, with her biological mother's permission and with our clearly developing bond, the authorities will permit me to adopt her, even though it's not the usual practice for a psychologist who works in a hospital to be able to adopt one of the abandoned babies who is at the hospital. In other words, it's unusual, yet still, due to the convergence of factors biological mother's permission, child's bond with me, my bond with the child, my strategizing and my implementing a plan, the adoption will be granted. Alsoearlierwhile at the apartment, while thinking about some of the challenges, another issue that crossed my mind was, how can I adopt this baby and care for Janie fulfill my obligations to Janie at the same time? Janie is 11 years old, and I see by how I feel now holding this baby with the baby molded against me, in my arms, feeling how soft the baby's skin is, etc. , how I long to have the experience of adopting a younger child i. e. , a baby, rather than a child Janie's age, so I am thinking about, 'I want to adopt this baby, I feel more drawn to adopting a child this agea babythan I do to adopting a child Janie's agecan I do both? Can I adopt this baby and yet also still fulfill my responsibilities toward Janie?' Also, earlier, while at the apartment, while discovering the areas of likely compatibility between us, at one point I heard the baby sing. The baby sang. And I found that the baby has a beautiful singing voicebeautiful enough to be a serious or even a professional singer. Most vivid aspect of this dreamthe physicaltactile experience of having the baby mold to and cling to me like Kufre Abazi. the softness of the baby's skin, the way that the place that the baby is attached to me from is similar to the place from which the baby arises in my silver mother. child statue, the physical feeling of carrying the baby in my arms holding her.\n",

      "2. another dream I have been in JordanI have spent some time in Jordan. Then, I go back to the States. Just for about two days or so two or three days. Then, I am signed up for a group tour I think it's from Temple Beth Avodah to go to Israel, on a Jewish. oriented tour, i. e. , a tour that will emphasize the Jewish narrative and the Jewish perspective. I think maybe it is to be led by Rabbi Miller. something about one of the images from that tour reminds me of the image of the wall with the various things, wheel, etc. on it at Angkor Watt, where I did some filming and discussion for Threads. dynamics of war, archetypal aspects of war, aspects of the human psychehuman behavior that lead to war or that perpetuate war, etc. chariots, leader behind, power, ruler, servants, etc. AnywayI go to the airport to meet up or to join the others in the tour. groupthis is the airport in the U. S. Somehow, while walking through the aisles of the airport to get to the gate area from where our flight to Israel will depart I lose my shoes the black suede shoes Merrils I do not know how that happened, but I am very indeciph. and now I'm without or they might be the black boots. I think at one point I indeciph. carry them in my hands to the indeciph. , and I'm walking in my stocking. feet, not knowing where my shoes are. Indeciph. At first I'm worried about that but then I realize it's not a big dealI can go onto the airplane in my stocking. feet, and buy shoes when I get to Israel, or maybe by then my shoes will come through the conveyor belt where the baggage is to be claimed. Then, somehow, partly as a result of my inquiry about the shoes and partly for other reasons, somehow, the other passengers have all boarded the plane, and when I approach the counter at the gate, I am told that the doors to the plane have been closed, all indeciph. , and I will have to take a different flight, the next morning. At first, I'm shocked, I cannot completely believe it, and I feel like maybe I can convince them to still let me on the plane, but then I realize that the doors really are closing, and there really is no way I can get on this flight. I feel disappointed and frustrated. Now, I have to go home, come back the next morning, and then fly to Israel, and then hook up with the group where it is. indeciph. words vivid imagechariotAngkor Watt vivid As I'm pondering the situationthe fact that I now have to lose a day, indeciph. a flight, the fact that I may have to pay for the ticket now though I probably won't, the hassle, etc. it occurs to me that I ought not to have gone all the way back to America from Jordan, just to then turn around and go to Israel, I ought to have gone directly from Jordan to Israel, and during those 2 or 3 days that I had available between ending my program in Jordan and needing to join up with the Jewish group in Israel, I ought to have just spent 2 or 3 days in Jerusalem, in a beautiful area of the hills of Jerusalem, where there would be pine trees andor the scent of pine such as the area near Tantour, I could have spent those 3 days resting and renewing myself, writing for example, writing something like a journal to indeciph. describing my experiences from the past year, or writing a letter to Lilalike I did at Dar Dhiyaffa in Jerba conifers pine I realize that that would have been a much better, wiser use of my time, and would have made much more sense, than my traveling all the way back from Jordan to Boston, and then 2 days alter going to the airport and flying another 7 hours all the way back to Israel So, as I'm making arrangements to come back to the airport the next morning and to fly to Israel from Boston, I think about how much more sense it would have made and how much more rested and renewed I would have felt if I had just gone directly to Israel from Jordan and spent my in. between days in Jerusalem. indeciph. A part of me does not really want to indeciph. the Jewish tour, not only because of the issues with the travel, the flight, etc. , but also because after having spent time in Jordan I feel much more inclined toward the Palestinian narrative and perspective and disinclined toward the Jewish one. But then it occurs to me that but then I realize that actually, this would be a good and appropriate time for me to reacquaint myself with the Jewish narrative and the Jewish perspective.\n",

After dark several of us meet up. The next day we're all doing some kind of activity in an adventure playground. There are high climbing frames made of tree trunks and rope swings. The surrounding landscape is pine forests. There are various daring games. In the dream I'm not with my partner yet, and afterwards I pluck up the courage to talk to her. She tells me she is going out with an old acquaintance. The next day we had to take a train across the country. The train has a dramatic front to it . like a 1930s version of a viking ship in gleaming steel.\n",

      "I obsessively put together a series of drawings, tracing the life of a woman from childhood to perhaps her death. I'm not sure who she is meant to be in the dream . perhaps an ex. girlfriend. But those I show the work to are not convinced of either the work or my reasons for doing it. Strangely I compile a selection of some of the better pieces and send them to the grieving family. I get no response. When I tell a couple of myfriends Terry and Ralph they find it embarrassing. Later in the dream I'm at what is meant to be the college where Terry teaches, but it is different larger, industrial bare concrete structure with very high ceilings, maze. like and dirty. I find him bracing what looks like a keyboard stand into the narrow vertical space in an alcove in a wall, somewhere tucked away behind a stairwell. Above it are several other metal objects piled on top of each other including bikes, some of it held with wires. It's a mess. Terry uses this stand in teaching as a prop or something. I then travel into town in some kind of wheelchair. It goes very fast. I'm in a large crowd of commuters, pulling myself along on railings. Most of the commuters are going the other way out of town but I'm in a solid stream of people going against the flow, like a boat cutting through waves. I notice Terry's dad coming by with the main mass of commuters, wearing dark glasses.\n",

      "I was in the city where I did my newspaper internship. There was a big festival. A carnival. The streets were packed. I left and decided to just hang out with a friend. The fireworks came. They were massive and brilliant. I was sitting with her alone in a dark outdoor place. I remember seeing the faint trail of a comet in the sky; not just a far. away check mark, but a hazy spray of particulated ice. These turned into the fireworks display; I was surprised, since most municipalities are cutting back on fireworks. I said I'm glad I did not drive. If I did, I would have just walked home.

      "This dream segued into one where I was back in Thailand at someone's house. It was grandma's birthday or something, and we had to drive to the party they were having for her at a restaurant. I hoped it would be at a traditional Chinese restaurant, dim sum. But, alas, it was an outdoor banquet place set up in the parking lot of a strip mall. The tables all had red tablecloths on them. We arrived by car. My father was in the car. Like in Asia, I did not trust his judgment but at the same time felt bad for him. A secret service agent or air force driver or something picked us up. We had connections. He was driving on the right side of the car. I remember not wanting to leave my headphones off, but I thought it will not be too long. I was going to stay at the airport hotel that night, and quickly need to catch my flight back home in the morning. I remember being back at their house and trying to find the right bedroom to sleep in. All the bedrooms seemed occupied. Even the bathroom had a mattress placed into the bathtub. That worked, I guess. A little ingenious use of space . for a person who does not mind living out of the bathroom. It was dark and cold in the house, like grandma's house. I remember going to the other bathroom for privacy.\n",

There was an old, supposedly empty office building in the same complex as the functioning offices. I had gone in repeatedly, because my world had been merged with one where instant travel, dream. like strange states and weird stuff, like alternate dimensions, were the reality. I asked my boss for the task of the day. She said to go follow up on some accounts, close a deal, something like that. I had a couple numbers. I thought this should be easy. Then I went out to do this. But I needed to go inside the abandoned warehouse, which existed in its own bubble of reality. It was completely flooded at one point. The drain goes down and away to some other place in time. I did not want to go in alone because I knew the host of that dimension, a rather scary woman who seemed like she held resentments. It was dank, old and musty like a back room of a bar I know. I'd gone in a little earlier to retrieve some of the things I'd left behind and got that very eerie vibe. Other scenes in this dream took me to an auditorium; felt like a large one on a college campus. People who I knew were there, and I think they were in on the alternate reality, but they all soon disappeared.\n",

When I woke up I opened it, but it kept on getting bigger and bigger until I unfolded it and it was the size of a map. It had a lot of really small handwriting on it and some sort of picture in the middle that said it would take me all day to figure out what it meant. Then I was in the car with my mom at Chick. Fil.

The child is being held by her mother, the child is being embraced by her mother, in her arms. There are tearsthe child she's a girl is crying, kind of sobbingand the mother is comforting herthe cryingsobbing has a healing quality to itas if something has been or is being healedthe crying has a quality of something like, reliefletting show the pain and fear that were present but which have now been responded to or addressed, as if the child, while in a particular situation, felt sad, but did not let go and cry about it then, kept it in more or less, and now, that scarysad time has passed or been shown to not be so scary and sad, and the child is now able to let go and cry, in her mother's arms, and her mother kind of 'sees the light' and feels compassion for her, getting in touch, now, with how the child has been feeling and what's been going on for the child internally, again it's a feeling kind of like that of 'lifting the veil', or 'the veil has been lifted', or 'Oh'. After some time like that, with the toddler she reminds me a little of Dorcity crying in her Forhat mother's arms, I see them mother and child get upi. e. , the mother gets up and I think the child toddlesthe child is wearing a diaperand they mother and child go into the bathroom rest room Meanwhile After they go the child tottles sic into the rest room, I am still in the waiting area, kind of looking at the space where they were just sitting, The mother is good. humored, good. natured, understanding vis. a. vis the child. At one point, during the crying i. e. in the midst of the crying, the child gives words to how she had been feeling shortly before, i. e. , says something like, I thought this, I felt this, etc. The mother is kind of like stroking her face or hair, holding her close, mother Forhat 'we are part of that stream of life which is so powerful' good. natured mother is good. natured reminds me of EamanIman. Yesthe mother reminds me of Iman. She has the appearance and style and manner of Iman but I have the sense that her name is Forhat we are part of the stream of life which is so powerful and the child reminds me of Michelle's child, Dorcity. And also, in some sort of way that is strange and complicated, the mother also embodies or reminds me of or has the essence of my mothermy mother both as a young woman around the age of her in that photo of her and my Dad on their honeymoon and as she is now, an old woman kind of like in Howe's Moving Castlethe thread that runs through from one age to the next from the young woman to the old woman and she is the same person because of the thread that runs through I'm in the waiting room, and to me it looks like, when the mother and child go to the bathroom, it looks like there is an absence, a space left where they had just been sitting, but meanwhile, within the consciousness of the mother and the childthey are going to the rest room but still have consciousness as they do so while it looks as though there is only an absence. My own experience, internally, is just kind of one of watching, with equanimity, taking in, beholding witnessing Silently bearing witness bearing witness to what is like in Zen 'Strange, is it not that of all those who pass the door of darkness through not one returns to tell us of the road which to discover he must travel too.

      "1. I am at or near the house on Nardell Rd. Something about the situation reminds of the swimming pool birthday cake my mother gave me when I was about 16 for my surprise birthday party. There is some sort of architect or designer landscape design? of a swimming pool, who is asking me where andor what to add on to the house, I get the idea of building a pool and a garden above the garage. the rooftop of the garage is flat, and nothing is on top of it i. e. , like my house on Newton Street in Cambridge not like the house on Nardell Rd. which had my parents' bedroom on top of it. i. e. , there is space on top of the garage there is space atop the garage open space on which something can be built and I see, howas does the landscape architect that on this space, on top of the garage, there can be a swimming pool and a garden. The swimming pool would be surrounded by the garden kind of like at Dar Dyafa. It would have lovely plants and flowers, alive ones, alive vegetation, and the water of the swimming pool, scene reminds me of the swimming pool on my birthday cake at my birthday party And I have this sense that this would be the right answer to the heaviness and density and gravity and pain of the energy in the garage the energy of death and mourning, i. e. , that just above it, in the space just above it, is a beautiful space of a swimming pool and gardens containingsurrounding it, where people can experience joy and aliveness and pleasure. and happiness. the garden has not just flowers but shades of green green plants, various kinds of green plants, schrubs sic, leaves, rhododendron, plants green plants, green leaves. As I visualize this, I have two questions or concerns I wonder, is there any risk that people swimming in the pool could be electrocuted or receive electric shocks because of the electric garage door which is located just beneath, I decide that that would probably not happen, because there is such a barrier, the roof of the garage, which is concrete, serves as a real barrier between the garage and its electricity, and the area of the swimming pool, and, second question, is there any risk that the water of the pool will be so heavy as to cause the roof of the garage to cave in? i. e. , I've heard that water, when it accumulates and is held in a tank. like place like that, can be heavy, and as it bears down on the ceiling of the garage, could it possibly make the ceiling cave in, eventually? 'the rock will wear away' 'the water and the rock' and my sense is that there are ways to address that concern, for example, to reinforce or undergird or strengthen the garage roof to be strong enough to withstand the weight of the water and not to cave in, to serve as a solid barrier so that the weight of the water from the swimming pool will not bear down on it so heavily as to cause it to sag. Earlierfor a variety of reasons it turns out that of a variety of houses I could have ended up owning or living in, through a series of events, I end up owning the house on Nardell Rd. Every time I see the garage at the house, the garage door is open, and I can see inside the garage. And every time I do, it makes me miss my father, and feel aware of the tragedy of my father's death. And I am not sure how to integrate that awareness and that painful knowledge of tragedy into my ownership of the house now, at a later point in time. What happened, happened, and I do not think there will ever be a time I can look at the garage and not painfully think of and remember my father's tragic end. I even imagine that I will purposely walk down to the garage and spend a little time in the garage, almost like a kind of pilgrimage, to purposely spend some time here and remember and allow myself to feel the pain and allow myself to be in touch with the last place my father was on earth i. e. , the place where he died. a place that I can go to to feel the heaviness and gravity of it the energy is quite dense and heavy almost like a meditation room\n",

      "I am on a ship. Something that looks like a kind of cruise ship, freighter, passenger type of ship. I am in a lower birth sic. down toward the basement of the ship. There is a female roommate with me. She reminds me of a number of people I've known in my lifepeople who have had babies and who have been tolerant of babies, patient with babies, relatively easy. going about babies. These people are like Cameron, Kristie, Elisabeth, and some others. The ship is, apparently, sailing sealing from Sierra Leone. I have made arrangements in advance to bring Janie. as. a. baby to the ship in preparation for our sailing to America with the planarrangement we have made. Janie is a baby who is still of the age of wearing diapersabout 2. 3 years old or even less, she is not yet very verbal, might be only a year old or even less. Or an earlier ageit's hard to say for sure. Even though Janie's parents and I have made all sorts of plans, in reality the plans do not turn out the way we had arrangedi. e. , the ship is due to set sail in about 1 hour, and somehow Janie gets dropped off at the door to my berth, without any parent being present with her, no note, no phone call, no message, nothing. I pick her up, she is a baby, at first I am just casually thinking of how it will be to have this baby with us on the long journey across the sea, to America but then I start to see that the situation is more complicated than I had expected, because her parents have not provided adequate equipment or supplies for her, for examplethe issue of the diaperpamper it occurs to me that we have this long journey ahead, and she has only the one diaper she's wearing which may even already be a little wet, there is no time now to go off the ship to buy diapers, so I am left with the question of, do I try to hope that I will find someoneanother motheron this ship who will give us some diaperspampers, do I let her go on this whole long journey with just one diaperpamper, which of course will become quite wet, do I run off the ship now to try to buy a box of diapers and then come back to the ship on time to set sail but that's not really an option because the ship is due to set sail in less than 1 hour about 45 minutes, and that would not be enough time to go off ship and come backI would risk missing the boat. The woman who is with me seems more relaxed about all of thisshe seems to feel that it will all work out okay and that the important thing is that I have the baby here with me, not the things like the pampers question. Another thing is that her parents did not give me any suppliessuch as a bag with various supplies in itfor the journey. And another thing is, they did not call me or get in touch with me before the journey it's not clear why not i. e. , were they just in a hurry and had no time, or were they being cruel i. e. , did they do this deliberately I am also troubled that they have not provided any paperssuch as a passport or other papers to show her identity and to show that I am making this trip with her with their permission that they have agreed to this trip. So, I am really afraid that later, i. e. , when we are in America, they are going to accuse me of traffickingthey're going to say that I took their baby without their permission baby does not look like Janiethe baby looks like Doorcity. I am afraid that they will accuse me of child trafficking and will say I took their baby without their permission or knowledge, and then will try to get a lot of money from meI feel anxious about thatI tell that to my roommate in the cellberth 'this might be some sort of scamSierra Leone is filled with scams. Maybe her parents did this whole thing7 indeciph. words without papersjust so that they could then sue me for money or getextort money from me. ' I feel very anxious about that. I want to call her parents to see if they would drop off at least a passport and identity papers, and a note or message attesting to the fact that they've given their permission for her to come with me on this trip to America and be under my care in America, but there is not enough timeeven if I reach them now, there will not be enough time for them to come all the way from the place where they live which is at least an hour from where the ship is docked and get the papers here on time. So, I am left with a situation where, on the one hand, there is not enough time to go off the ship to buy supplies for the journey and come back to the ship on time, and on the other hand there is also not enough time to call her parents and ask her parents to bring supplies to the ship before it sets sail, and also, she does not have what she needs for the journey, unless I want to risk letting her go the whole journey in one pamper and being accused of trafficking, later, because she has no papers, I feel quite anxious about this especially the papers issue, but my colleague who is in the birth sic with me seems to feel that somehow we will manage, that it will be all right colleague is a blend of Cameron and Elisabeth, I think and Kristiethat somehow we will manage, that what's important is not the supplies per se but that what's important or at least, what's most important is not the supplies issue or even, perhaps, the papers issue, but the fact that she is here in my arms, in my berth, she has gotten here in my berth somehow though not in the usual way, what's important is that she is here, somehow, she is here with us my colleague and me and as long as she is here, we can manage, we can cope with it, and one way or another, it will be all rightwe will manage. the baby also reminds me of Miatta and Sylvester's baby and my roommate also reminds me a little of Miattathough I'm not sure about that the baby understands a part of what we my roommate and I are saying and thinking and feelingour worry, our anxiety. She understands a certain amount of language, and also she picks up on my feelings e. g. , my anxiety. She understands, but there seems to be little or nothing she can do because she is a baby, and basically, the ball is in my courtthe power to choose is mine, it is up to me whether to take her on this journey in these circumstances, with these difficulties and risks, it is not up to her whether I do soI am the one who has to choose. So, she is just kind of here, as a baby she did not even choose to come to my berth, she somehow was brought here she somehow ended up at my door she was placed at the door to my berth in the basement of the ship, it's not clear how she got herethat's not clear it's a mystery it's a mystery how she ended up at my door who placed her here how she got here She does not know and neither do I. But she has not power to choose, she's just a baby, In this situation, I am the one who has the power to choose and who has to take the decision to travel with her holding her carrying her in my berth, across to the other side or not. The other woman I am withmy berth. matebelieves that I should, that I mustthat I will cope with the challenges and difficulties. She seems to feel quite clear that I must not reneg sic on the plan or on my promise and I must not abandon this baby, I must accept the situation as it isi. e. , the fact that I have just the baby, in the diaper she has on, with no identity papers and no supplies and that Iwe she and I will cope somehow, we will find a way, 'there is an answer, and we'll find a way, help us to leave the past behind us. ' It the situation is kind of like, or kind of reminds me of, a situation of like, 'God will provide' 'GWP', or where you say to yourself that God will provide, that all that you need is the shirt on your back and not much elselike a pilgrim, who goes on a pilgrimage but without supplies, trusting that he will receive what he needs along the way like those people in Buddhism in India and Cambodia who survive by going around receiving almsmonks, and nunsor like Christ's disciples emissaries, 'all that you have is your soul'i. e. , trusting the process, trusting the universe, trusting God, to provide what you need each day, as you go along, day by day, on the journey, 'it will be okay' 'we will cope' 'it will be okay' 'God will provide' 'You are the chooser'\n",

I could not really tell if these events were in the present or the past, or the future, I just knew that they were, and I kind of saw them unfolding before me. Mom and Dad had come home early from their trip to my relative's home town, and were planning to go on a long boating trip on some river leading to some far. away jungle place! They would be riding in and driving a small boat like the ones we would rent when we'd go out with Aunt Janice. But their trip would take days, weeks or months. I was relieved that I really did not have to go. I did not want to go, and was not planning to go, but in this dream, I sort of saw myself on the water with them, in the open ocean at the mouth of this river that they were about to travel. Mom had a newborn baby in her arms, named Missy or Sissy or something. Apparently, Mom and Dad had made whoopee somewhere in the woods which would not be that surprising, provided they were getting along, and now, I had a baby sister! I kind of felt glad and amazed, but yet was dismayed. I knew that all of our lives would change, especially Mom's. I felt very sorry for her, since she would have to do it all over again; the sleepless nights, the diapers, the homework, the full compass of parenting! There were more complicated twists to this, but I cannot remember them. I subtly remember being slightly afraid of the boat; it's motor, its radio, but not the water! That's how I always felt as a child; afraid of the motor but not the water! There was something to do with Sycamore Gardens being one of the stops of this trip which was sort of in the present and sort of in the future without me! Gosh, that was so bizarre!\n",

It turns out that the film features me the 'me' that has the squat and mental health issues. I remember looking down at my legs at one point, and noticing that they are bruised and that one of them has a huge blister on it. It looks like leprosy or some very serious skin disease. There's a scene in the film where I drive a car up some steps and smash through someone's front door and into their flat.

There was an accident. Nazi KKK members were involved. It had the makings of a good story. The injured man was a fat Hispanic family man on vacation with his wife. I tried to talk to him, but his English was bad and I could not understand. I did not know if he was talking in Spanish or Portuguese.

      "270.  Melatonin  I was in the living room of my parents' house playing a basketball video game with Justin. It was some nation. wide contest. And I bet Justin in the game and won! I was shocked this happened. The prize was thousands to millions of dollars . a lot of money. I was very excited. I was thinking about all the traveling I was going to do around the world. That's all I wanted to buy with it, was plane tickets to travel. Dad told me that a man in a limo was going to pick me up tomorrow to give me the money and explain things. This excited me. Then I remember being back in high school. I would always go hang out in the band room with Justin and Hewson, etc. before it started. Then I would be at lunch, never in an actual class. I ate lunch with Reva and 4. 5 other people. They had a bad selection. Then I remember going to Rev's room that had the same carpet as mine. She was showing me these wooden signs she painted for a Valentine's party. They were red and white. I moved back home at my parents' house and sitting in my old room. It looked like it did 4 years ago. I started to take the things off the wall and threw my belongings. Then when my mom walked down the stairs to tell me that the things I was doing , I did not need to do. I yelled at her and threw a pillow and then my dad came down and yelled. After they left I began to cry, I felt weird afterward for doing so.\n",

      "I was in the back yard of a house near the rural forest area in Vermont or something like it. My family is there. We are on vacation; I find an old Thompson World War II gun in the house. We hear all kinds of noises in the back yard. I climb up into a wood fort that was built to see what the commotion was. Turns out, the woods were thick with animals. At first there were just raccoons. Many of them milling around. I hate raccoons. I took a shot at one. The gun, an automatic, was fairly inaccurate. I fired in bursts that made the muzzle climb. The raccoons ran off, but came back. Eventually, the animals grew bigger and more dangerous. Two black bears tried to enter the neighbor's house. I did not want to shoot the house so I did not shoot at them. Then there was a huge shape, like a big old wolf. It was stalking up the hill. It was big enough to be scary. My brother James and my sister were in the fort with me. I told them to stand away from the entrances. There were two, located to one side of the thing that was built like a tree house. It's good the entrances were near each other, I thought, because it would be easier to defend. My siblings picked up 2x4s and held them en garde toward the open doors. I fired shot after shot and the wolf ran away. Then there was a puma or panther climbing on a nearby roof. It was also big enough to be deadly. I fired. It ran away also. I was not sure if I had hit anything. The gun felt sort of weak. Then two more bears appeared in the water below. They were swimming after fish. My brother Gerald appeared, and started to reach in after them. I told him to stop, not only because the bears were big and dangerous, but because if they attacked him, they would have to be killed by the park rangers. I like bears and I did not want to see them hurt. I shoot in the water to make them go away. They ran away under the dock. I wondered where they all sleep during the day, since there are so many in such a small area and few places to hide. A giant freshwater stingray appears in the water. To test the gun, I fire one shot at its large, un. missable shape floating in the shallows, and it starts bleeding. I check. I have 18 shots left. I then see the neighbors in the nearby house across a big field searching their own property. I want to say hello and introduce myself as the new neighbor, since everyone else would have been too shy, I climbed down and began to walk over. Then, in the open field, a black bear appears. There may have also been a lion, but it ran away. In the middle of the field, it got closer. I yelled at my brothers and my sister to climb up into the neighbors raised fort platform. They do not see the danger. I stand my ground in the field to keep the bear back. It is all black but has a white tuft on the top of its head. It begins to charge. I shoot. They seem to have no effect. I wait for it to get closer. I measure my ammo. I shot again. Nothing. Then, knowing I only have one burst left, I wait until it is almost on top of me, then pull the trigger. I aim for its face. I see its teeth and tongue hanging out. It crumples before me, looking small and weak suddenly. I see another, smaller, bear and worry now that I am out of ammo. But I realize it is the cub of the bear I had just killed. I was sad. I thought it might be best just to kill it. But I had no ammo. It would not survive in the wild on its own. I raised the butt of the rifle to kill it the Thompson had turned into a shotgun . one I had bought, or was thinking of buying, in the dream before this one that's hazier. Then my mother showed up and the bear ran to her. It climbed up and she held it. She said she'd take care of it. I went over and petted the little bear. I said Ok, but just know it will never be able to go back into the wild and will need to live in a special facility. I dragged the bear carcass over to the neighbor's back porch. They were rednecks. They had guns themselves. They seemed welcoming enough. There was the wife, the husband and at least one kid. I told them I killed this bear. I wondered if they had a scale. They did not answer immediately. I thought it was silly to drag a dead animal with you when meeting someone for the first time. But I suppose that was common here. I put the bear on a bathroom scale they had out. It came in at 90 pounds. I thought it was much bigger. It was bigger when it was running at me. I was disappointed. Then the husband gave me a hanging scale. I hung it up onto the garage door track. And put the hook into the bear's mouth to hoist it. Same or similar weight, though the thing was hard to use. It had all kinds of temp readings on it, and a radio tuner for some reason. Later I was walking down the street to get out of town and drive back home. I then started driving. There was so much traffic. I did not want to get caught up in any of the traffic. So I decided to get out and wait it out. I got out and started walking. A girl got out of a bus. She was driving. She was young and pretty, with long, straight dirty blonde hair. She asked if I was Van. She had heard things. Good things. I was a growing legend around there. She asked if it was true I was a world. class diver. I said, well, maybe not world class. But I did kill a bear. I thought to myself, next, it's going to grow into I killed a bear with my bare hands. She said she had to go off and tell her friend she met me.\n",

I've worked out this is some kind of tourism company that's employing me. This whole town seems to be one big money. making machine for milking tourists.

When he sees me he smiles, but his smile seems double. edged not genuine. Back in town, I'm aware that the town is like a trap or a maze. Once you're inside, it's almost impossible to find your way out. There are rides that take you through the streets, that weave in and out of a three dimensional spaghetti jumble of tourist shops, garish signs and cartoony fibreglass models. It seems people do not even have the freedom to walk anywhere . you have to travel on rides. They are like little bumper cars or roller. coaster cars. Behind the bright plastic and lights, if you look carefully, you can make out the workers . slightly depressed looking people in something like McDonald's uniforms with caps. They look greasy and dirty and bored. They are mostly immigrants. This is a dirty and sickening place.\n",

      "I'm feeling pretty tired, but I think I've got some writing to do. Well, to start with, I had a really wacky dream last night, actually two of them. First of all, I was on some kind of organ tour thing like my Phoenix trip. We were going around and seeing different instruments. Somehow, I got the crazy notion that an organ could sometimes be located in the back of a fire truck! We would be visiting a few fire stations that had such a setup. It was a double. edged sword. Of course I'm always thrilled to be near a pipe organ, but am practically terrified of other loud things. I never will quite understand that! So I was extremely afraid of the whole situation. It was such that you had to had to run the siren while the organ was playing because of a particular composer's wishes. The only visual memory that I have of this dream is that I was sitting inside at the dinner table that they had at Station 11, with some of my friends from Phoenix, looking at a score. They actually notated a siren sound by drawing a long, continuous line across the staff. It had a double beam underneath it as though it were just a long, continuous stream of unidentified 16th notes. Then, I faded into the next scene. It was my birthday, and I had thrown a party for myself, as I've done for the last few years. Nobody came, and I was feeling really disappointed. Dad was giving me a lecture to the effect that I had no right to be disappointed, for me and my birthday were not that important in people's lives. Of course, this did not help, and actually made it worse. I thought in my mind how I'm probably getting too old for birthday parties, and that's probably why people were not coming. I just had to get away from the house. I had to go and make myself happy. After all, you cannot sit around waiting for others to make you so, and there was still time to salvage the evening. In this dream, I could just get in the car, start the engine, press a button and it would just drive. It knew innately somehow where I wanted to go. I traveled over the Skyway, and almost instantly arrived at Roaring 20s. I had the right to just walk in and play, for Don and Bill knew me very well. The place was totally empty, just like Highland Pizza was closed to the public when we played there. I rode the lift up high as I played a polka medley. I was crying, still broken. hearted over my failed birthday, and was glad that my back was to everyone in the dining room. But with every measure, my spirit rose higher and higher. By the time I had finished, a few people were sitting out there. Just then, Mom called me on my cell phone and told me that 6 or 7 people had shown up at the house expecting there to be a party, and they were still there. I was deciding whether I wanted to go home and be with these people, or just enjoy being down in Allarton, and have 'em come on down!\n",

      "I must tell you about my dream last night. It began as a rather hodgepodge of scenes. I needed to regularly travel from my high school to APC, and back home again. I could have been a teacher, but I felt like a student. I must have been a dual. enrolled senior or something. This was another of those quasi. driving drams. It seemed all I needed to do was go out to the Grandpa truck, climb into the passenger seat, and crank it up. It just sort of naturally went where needed to go by happen. chance or luck, not unlike a Ouija board or something. I felt the risk involved, but I figured that I'd had good luck thus far, and that it was just one of life's inherent risks. I rode like this several times in this dream. When I got to the school, however, people were getting right in my face and lecturing me on how dangerous and unsuitable this arrangement was. So, I decided that I'd better just ride a school bus home. In the afternoon, the bus would be taking students from the college back to the high school. I was on the bus, and there was a lot of noise. Next thing I knew, I was in a misty, foggy setting, unsure where I was. This is the important part  When I was in third grade, our class memorized and recited the Langston Hughes poem 'Mother to Son'. I have not even thought of that poem for at least 15 years!! I was thinking of it in my dream, auditing the fragments of text which I remember. Thinking of 'places with no carpet on the floor', feeling frightened by 'sometimes going in the dark, where there ai not been no light. ' I began to imagine an interesting choral setting of the poem, loaded with chromatic vocalizes, really playing on the endless references to stairs. Naturally, the sopranos climbed into the stratosphere for the phrase, 'But all the time I's been climbin' on. ' In my setting, it would be 'I've been'. The baritones and basses would color the passage about darkness, which reminded me of the cellar stairs, and other strange places where I could be trapped. I did not imagine any notation or practical music theory, just the sounds. It was complex, like a Shostakovich orchestral work.\n",

It gets hazy after that. I wake up to my alarm and go to clock in and clock out, just like every day.\n",

      "Last night I had a dream that I had to go to Japan with my mother for some reason. We drove to the airport, which was at my high school, and I was able to pack everything into this small DVD case. I asked if we were going to drive to California and fly from there, or if we were just going to drive to JFK and fly from there. My mother said it would be better to just drive to JFK. We got onto the plane, and even though the flight was supposed to be 12 hours, we were only going for 1 day. When we got to Japan, I remember that instead of all the skyscrapers, there were these incredible trees from Avatar. They had these phosphorescent leaves that lit up depending on the season. I guess all the seasons went by in the 1 day we were in Tokyo, because the leaves changed from pink, to orange, to green, to blue, which was supposed to indicate a whole year going by. They were beautiful against the night sky. On the way home, my brother and my father joined us, and we all went to a dentist's office together. I do not know why, but apparently the dentists were better in Japan. The dentist spoke English, but all the magazines in the waiting room were in Japanese. The dentist was eating yogurt and a Snickers bar, which I remember thinking was weird, since he was a dentist and should not eat candy. This dentist turned out to be an old friend of my mother and father's, and we stayed at his house for another night for a party. The dentist was an older man, and I found him very attractive, even though I do not find older men attractive in real life. He was putting all this food on the tables to occupy everyone, and then he cornered me and started flirting with me. I think I had been drinking wine, because I felt a little giddy and flirtatious too. He was wearing a gray suit and looked very sharp. Then I woke up.\n",

      "I had a dream that my family and I were all going somewhere, but I cannot remember where it was or why we were all there. My mother and I wanted to go home early, so we took one of the cars. We were at a rest stop, when I realized that we had somehow taken both cars, but I had not been driving. My mother said she had been driving each car in shifts, because they were both some kind of new stick shift I did not know how to drive yet. I was also dreaming about floating down some river with other RAs, and that was our mid. year training. Later, Gage and I were talking, and he was telling me about how every couple in our grade was breaking up before graduation. I was shocked, but really relieved that I would not have that same problem.\n",

      "303. 2 Next dream I am at work at the drive through but it is up very high and the cars are down below, then a limo comes through with a family in it and a fireplace in the back. They send up money, a big wad just rubber banded together. I was so amazed because I needed money. Linnea, some other girl with curly hair and some other man were there. I felt bad for having all the money, so I gave them each 150. Then work slowly turned into a cooking class. We had a teacher we hated. She was an older woman who was hardly there. We all wanted drinks from a vending machine. So I said that I would pay. Then I I remembered where the closet vending machine was so I go down the hallway and stairs to it. There was a boy with blonde hair getting a turkey sandwich flavored drink. I kept on looking for money and eventually found it in my wallet. But then Linnea comes up and starts to tell me about a sex kitchen store across the street, so we go. It is almost a treehouse type thing with an enclosed wooden staircase to the top. When you got to the top there was a little door and we both bumped our heads on the ceiling. Inside were dogs that were mistreated and needed to be let out everything was old and rundown, we were playing with them. Then I found a little box of rings and whistles by a window. I stole two turquoise and gold rings. Then one of the dogs jumped on me and whispered to my ear, 'Do you have to go to the bathroom?' This is when we started to get wigged out. There was a door open that never was before. So as we are running out, I notice a sign that say, 'No cursing. ' We get back to a commons type area for our cooking class, talking to other people. All of a sudden there is a translucent netted fabric covering the people sitting on the ground. Everyone else could feel it, but only we would see it. Then we saw the ghost of a young girl. She had put some sort of curse on us. We had to follow her rules to get it taken off no cursing and we had to iron the sheet among other things. Hazy. Next thing I know I have to fight with these demon ghost things in a grocery store taking and throwing food at each other. The last one through was Oreo but then they turned into something so small they disappeared.\n",

      "Last night I had a very vivid series of dreams. First, I was talking to Keegan in what seemed to be his house. He was waiting for baseball practice and I was waiting for some other athletic event in the field house as well. We were just talking and it was fun! Then he said he wanted to introduce me to his mother, but since we had only met this semester, I figured he was just being friendly. Still, I was flattered and excited. But then I think we had to drive to the field house because his practice was starting soon. We drove over there and then that was the end of that. Then I was in my high school dining hall with Alondra and some random freshmen from college. I was trying to explain why this new painting called Emily Combusted was so important and innovative. It was on the front page of the New York Time Arts section. I was talking about how it was part of this new movement called ir. realism, which is a post. modern sort of surrealism, a style of painting that encompassed the subconscious and wanted to investigate its inner workings, but did so in a more politically self. conscious way. The exhibition that was being reviewed in the Times comprised some hundred paintings that were like Dali paintings looked at through a microscope far away. The details were incredible, the anguish on Emily's face so powerful. It was new and fun and exciting seeing this art in the paper.  Then my father was swimming in the Olympics and got a bronze medal!\n",

They were going to his house. We say, 'Yes, those fuckers finally got caught,' and I flipped them of fas we are pulling into a driveway. I had to follow Alyssa to get to some doctor. We were going to take Jeremiah too, because he told us something weird. When I go back to get him he is a baby and I am trying to teach him how to walk across the street. Rachel comes out to my house and rings the doorbell. Following her is Jake H. they come in and I give them a tour. More and more people start showing up. We are outside in the back yard. We cannot decide on whether to go in or stay out. Eventually we are inside a huge house other than mine. Jake pulls me aside to the other room, starts to tell me how he cannot resist me and starts to kiss me. I think it is funny so I go with it. He is horrible at it. Then I think that I start to swim, in a pool in the house with other people. Then I am in the other room talking to people, then I go to the next. Everyone is eating whipped cream, there was not any for me and there has been a buffet I missed. This hot married girl and I start dancing. She is very drunk but her husband takes her away. I am doing something outside of Blockbuster when they are taking everything out and closing it down. They put in new floral carpet. I am standing by a mailbox.

We have to move back, cannot go near it any more. The flames are bright yellow, and the fire is roaring. I wonder if the tree will fall down. That was not our intention, but we should move back, away from the danger. I'm traveling with people in a car, around the coast of a continent. Like I'm driving, but also looking down at the car on a topographical map. like the southern tip of South America. I'm glad someone is helping us drive. We're going slow.

      "306.  Drunk  I am downtown with some friends, we make our way back to the parking lot to where Chris parked. We do not want to approach it because there was some strange man standing by it with big eyes. Once we get closer he pulls down his pants and takes a shit on the ground, then pees on the car. People thought it was so funny. I was disgusted by it. I go run by some kids near bushes to hide from the man; during this, a magician comes up to me to do a magic trick. I take his card and throw it on the ground. But then I see the strange man, so I tell the magician to talk to me so he wo not. But I guess they were friends and the strange man starts to touch my knees. So I ran away. This man starts to become very popular. I could not stand him. It is a little hazy how it transitioned, but I grab my dream catcher, two pillows and a blanket. I left and went to this big dock by a lake, there was a big time machine that was silver. I cannot remember if I set the time or if it just took me there during the Civil War. I am running through a field and hide in a purple tent. Inside is a fairy that is tiny, now I am tiny as well. We have to be very still and quiet. I could see the shadows of the soldiers march back and forth and hear the trumpets go off in the morning but there would be people that would look for you because they knew people would travel in time and they would try and catch you. I wanted to find the Indians so the fairy led me to their wick up. I brought them my dream catcher and they accepted me. The girl warned me that I am white and white men are the enemy. The girl and I would hide under their bed while the people would come look for me. Also my family would look for me. They were not the same. They were all amazingly fat. Then I fell asleep on the bed. I started to dream that I was in a small department store and saw Hewson, Greg and Holly. But they were all super young. I figured out that I was dreaming and started to float through the air. I wanted to get back though so I start going up and down the aisles looking for a green basket, to breathe into, that would take me back. I could not find it. During this time I found a closet that took me back to the Indian's bed. When I woke up still in the dream there was a spider in a web right above my head. I slip out from underneath it and I have to hide again. I decide that I hate hiding and wanted to go back to my time. I thank and hug the Indian for letting me stay. I think that they were gay. Then it starts to get hazy.\n",

      "I had a dream that I was in some Health class or other with Tony and other sophomores. We had to give presentations that day, and I guess I had thought I was presenting much later, because I realized I was not prepared. I had to present on Lolita and then relate how that had to do with sexual abuse and rape. I had written some sort of song and had condoms with me to give out to the rest of my class. When my professor called on me, I panicked, but ended up having to present anyway. I think the presentation ended up going pretty well. Tony, as he was leaving, asked me out on a date and suggested taking me out to dinner. Of course I accepted, but then remembered that I was dating Philip. The next day, leading up to the date with Tony, I asked my friends if I should just break up with Philip, rather than cheat on him. I wondered why I was with Philip again since it had not worked out the first time. Then I was on a golf course wearing pink shorts and pink ankle socks and little golf shoes. I had on a white tank top and a pink ribbon in my hair, and I was skipping near where Tony was playing golf, flouncing and flirting and showing off. Then I had to drive a golf cart with Martin and one of his friends home. I was baking almond cookies that were not yet done, but I had already taken out of the oven. Martin and his friend kept trying to take them off the cookie sheet, which made me really frustrated. Then myfather came home from wherever he was and we were planning to have dinner at 730.\n",

      "309. The first thing I can remember is going down a gravel road I have gone down before in other dreams leading to a house in the woods. It is a house with white wood, torn down slightly. There is an upstairs, basement and main level. There are always many things going on in most all levels, usually with a fear of police or authority showing up. There is a party going on with lots of people. For some odd reason I had taken my mom with me. She was drinking as well as I, but she wanted to leave and I wanted to stay. So she made me find my own way home. I was kissing all sorts of people at this party, I hoped that my mom did not see. There was this really skinny black girl and Kalaheme. a lot of things but then I realize that I need to leave, police were coming and I need a ride. I find one with my brother, then it gets a little hazy. We drive off somewhere, now it is daylight and Evan, Matt L. , my brother and I are sitting in my car on the side of this road by some houses, just sitting and smoking with all the doors open. Then in a black jeep driving by is Alex. We all wave and hope he would stop. We drive down to the same area he is going which is by a trail, a clothing store, and barclub type place. Now Richard is there, this part is getting hazy as to what happened next. Oh wait, so I just walked into the clothing store, right after me was Alex in complete drag. It was so funny!!! He is acting nervous about it. I talk and dance with Richard and Evan talked to various people. I saw Alex was now in a dark, weird costume doing this routine, being hooked up to this electronic machine that keeps on shocking him. Then there were a bunch of drag queens on stilts; they pick me up and lift me over their head. It was scary but fun. We are all about to leave. We go out the back door. There is a little woodenporch deck. Alex is sitting on it with a backpack, looking normal. This transition is hazy, but we kept on going back at my parents house which looked pretty similar to now. We are on my bed and he has turned into an eagle, but I still could talk to him. He started to morph and change back into a man, but this time it was Brooke L. , sitting there half man half vampire. looking. I asked him if he had done that for Greg. He said that he had. Then it was Alex. I left to go to the bathroom. As I am in the bathroom my mom comes knocking on the door asking me if I was alright, being very strange. Then I think, 'Oh god. ' Alex was upstairs, my mom was very drunk, asking him what his salary was and he pulled out a packet of Taco Bell sauce so weird. Then she got his number from him and put it in her iPhone; he left. This made me mad. I tried to look for it but I could not figure out her phone. I meet up with Holly again and we become friends, planning something.\n",

      "565 Last night I had a dream that we were in a store. When we first went in, it kind of seemed like the Cracker Barrel, but as we were walking around, it kind of turned into a Walmart. Sam was looking for some kind of book that he wanted to give Dad. Dad was generally being a cranky jerk like he can be sometimes. He was looking for like, I do not know, paint or something and Mom was looking for something too, and I was just kind of like bored to death, not sure what to do. And I got the feeling we were not in my home town I got the feeling we were like in another city or something, although I was not going to school. We were doing something, some kind of one of those trips that we used to do of something, and I was looking around and I was seeing these different stuffed bears and things. And I was trying to think to myself how I wish I could just go home. I'm going to think for a minute what else there was to this. I was really angry in this dream because of how Dad was acting. I do not remember anything he actually said, but he was doing that thing where he was taking a kind of a little thing and blowing it out of proportion, where something that was not an ill intent at all, he was taking to make Mom feel like she was being selfish just because she was not thinking of him like 24 hours a day, seven days a week. And, like I said, we were out somewhere in some of the city, and I was thinking how I had the notion that he might leave the store and walk somewhere and how Mom and I had the car keys, and how I wanted to go home so bad. And I was thinking to myself in this dream that if I just wished hard enough, I could get home. And then, well, I was not really feeling like I could drive in this dream. I was just feeling like if I wished hard enough, I could get the car to go home all by itself kind of a thing. But then somehow things changed in this dream. I do not know how it went from a Walmart store to being at a Sycamore Gardens like type place, but it did. Mom and Dad and Sam were still busy diddling in the store, but somehow I found a way to like get outside to this path that was very much like Sycamore Gardens, and I was walking around through these different paths and bushes and things, and just being outside, I felt so much more at peace. And being away from everybody, I felt a lot better. And I heard this harmonica player. I could not really tell where he was, but he was on one of the bench pavilion things and he was off in the distance. And I went around again and I came to a flamingo exhibit that, you know, they do not have any more animals any more, but that used to be the fun of going there, to see the animals. And so there were two flamingoes that had flown outside the exhibit, but I could climb on the rocks and I could climb down inside the exhibit to go and see them. And they all came up to me. They were the most tame and gentle birds you could ever know. And I was petting them, and there was this one I picked up, and they were just really tame and they made me feel much better. And then somehow I was back up on the path again and there was a really sweet flamingo  just standing there. It was not going in the exhibit. And then there were these dogs, these little puppy dogs that came along in this park  and kind of scared them. And then I woke up.\n",

Oh no, I realize I'm going to fall all the way in. What about my cell phone in my front right pocket?. I go into the water about to my chest, and quickly grab the phone and pull it out of the water. It seems ok. I get out, and keep going. Later I push through some tall ferns, about chest height, onto a big trail or fire road, with other people walking. I keep going. It's very muddy. I stop at one point to look at the remnants of mud slides up the hill to my left. it's cool, I'm intrigued by the long straight slide cutting through the trees and vegetation. Soon I get to a muddy little hill on the trail, I have to climb over it. I use a screw driver in my hand to dig into the muck and pull myself up. There's a guy who started up the hill just when I did, and he takes a lower and easier route up and over. I'm in bare feet. I think to myself, will I keep on like this, in such difficult conditions?. Yes, I decide I will. I'm at a bookstore with Ronald and others. I see Frank and his family. I say to Ronald hey look, there's your friend.

      "570 I had a couple dreams last night. Let's see, first I was doing something at school. And I do not know what it was, but I was with a group of other students, like some of the ones from the organ group and we were going into a place that was like the Bancroft gym and they said that there was going to be a Celine Dion concert, and that they were going to take pictures and do a sound check and everything, and they were going to let us in ahead of time. And so I was with Lana Tripp and she took me right down in front, and we were sitting and waiting for the concert to start. This gym had a dome, like the  dome, and it was all blue. And then when the concert started, they would project different images on it and stuff. And it seemed like they were taking forever to get things together. And I really did not hear anything at the sound test, I did not see any behind. the. scenes things. There were two or three clowns dancing around and acting crazy, and a person behind the stage doing the sound test. It was really just other people doing really boring stuff, like a typical sound test would be. And so I was talking to Lana Tripp but I was digging in my purse and I was getting my new monocular and I was starting my recorder, and I was trying to use my cell phone to call home to tell Mom where I was and what I was doing. I felt like we were close to home, and I had to meet up with her later that night to do something. And every time, I found out the hard way why they tell you not to use cell phones because when I would use my cell phone and talk, the sound would somehow weaken the PA so you could not hear it like in the concert hall, so like everybody could hear what I was saying. I was so embarrassed. But then the concert was about to start and everybody was parading around on the first song It was like a Prince song. I could not hardly hear that well, even though we were right down front. And she was wearing that metal like top that you see in the Taking Chances tour video. And then I woke up and I was like, I moved on, I did not wake up, but I moved on to the next scene. I needed to connect with Mom because I was having an organ recital that evening at the Palladium. It was going to be, I thought it was going to be just me for a whole hour, but as it turned out, it was me and this other boy that I met on our trip that was going to do the finale. And I was thinking to myself, 'Do I know enough repertoire to fill up a half an hour?' And are my silly, diddly little corral preludes going to be enough to satisfy them, or are they going to want big honking, loud and like Widor stuff? And I did not even know the organ, and it was like the night of the show. And Mom took me there, and we got there like about 700 and I was supposed to play at 800. And . There was a bedroom in there for artists to stay in. It was like a hotel room that was backstage. And there was this, I do not know why, but I was laying down in this bed, waiting for somebody to roll the organ out. And I was laying in bed and there was like a pedal board attached to the foot board and I was trying to practice one of my pieces with my hands in the air. And I was like, 'This is like so not working!' And then I was going up the stage to the organ to get settled, and I was thinking, 'God, I have like no time to like a practice my piece to get the feel of the action and b settle my stops and my pistons and everything. ' And I did not even know if we were allowed to set pistons. And I just put on something that sounded kind of cheesey like an 8 foot and a 2 foot flute stop, and then just a regular diapason 8 foot on the Great. And I was practicing, it was not really anything actually that I know, it was just something. And then this other boy came up, and it was like 730 by that time and it was time for him to play his piece. And I was really worried about how it was going to go, but I just figured what the heck. I mean, I'm just gona' have to wing it. And then he seemed kind of nice, like he's going to help me set the pistons. And then I woke up.\n",

I did not know anything about sculpting, but now, I know something about it. Was it worth staying up for? Thank goodness I do not have to go anywhere. I'm a wreck this morning. . Last night I can only remember one dream that I had. I was at Safeway looking at . Actually . Before that I was  with Mrs. Lotts, and she was teaching a lesson at Terri's house. And it was dark and it was dingy. Actually, wait. Before that, See, when you think about things remember more of it. I was playing the piano for Mrs. Lotts's choir and we were in a school room. And I was playing these simple little songs like 'Hark the Herald Angels Sing' and different little carols and  . And I was playing them all in the key of D, and I probably should not have done that. But I guess the ones that are in penta chord form I should play in D because that's the range for a young child's voice; it sets the best in their head voice. And in my dream pretty much all these songs were in penta chord form, so I guess that's why I played them all in D. And I was just sort of tape goes blank. For most of them I was able to fudge my way through in accompaniment style, and then I said we were in a classroom while we were doing this. She had this Irish song that was a more complicated arrangement, and it had a recorder solo. And she had a little organ in the music room. It was like the one I practiced on at the college. It was a little, little bitty, bitty, bitty pipe organ with a free. standing case. But she made it play really loud with mixtures and a full chorus and everything and a recorder solo was heard above it. I do not remember which song it was, but it was something. And that little children's choir was able to sing out above that loud organ. And then next thing I know, she and I and her kids were at Terri's house with some bizarre reason. And I do not even remember what we were doing. I think it was some kind of a lesson, but I do not remember what it was. And then there was this book, and it had this story that like went on forever, and it was all supposed to be sung. And I was just flipping through it and reading the words and glancing up at the staff every now and then to kind of see what the melody was doing. And I could not really understand it. It was like chant or shape notes or something wacko like that. And I was thinking to myself, 'I hope Terri's alarm does not work any more and I hope she  whatever. ' Because Terri was not home and we were just like crashing in her house . And there was something more to this, but I cannot remember what we were doing. I do not know. Then suddenly I was walking to Safeway, and I was roaming around, I had all these bags like Mom brings and I was trying to look for groceries. But I could not find anything. I wandered through this part of the store that had a wood floor  table, and some people were having like a banquet there, you know like those catered things sometimes. And I was hungry; I wanted some. But I was not invited, so I could not barge in. And I was wandering around and wandering around and looking and looking, and I was able to find a few things, but it was not really near what I had come for. And then I went out to the parking lot because I thought somebody was going to drive me home. Somebody had talked to me at one time that they were going to drive me home. And this Grandpa truck was in the parking lot and I had the keys and I opened up the door, and I turned the ignition to run position so that the accessories would run, and there was some jazz, 98. 7 on the radio. And I loaded up the one or two bags of groceries that I had and I was sitting there listening for like a half an hour. And nobody showed up to drive me home. And this time in this dream, I did not even want to drive. And so I turned off the ignition and locked it with the key, like it was a car. And I locked up the door and I took my groceries, and this time when I got out of the truck, I not only had my two bags of groceries, I had like bazillions of water jug bags, just like Mom has. They were all empty. And I was going back in the door, and I came in like a back door, and I was standing there like blah. And some lady said, 'Oh, I'll take those for you because I'm going to go and get water myself. ' And I gave them to her, and then as soon as I gave them to her, and then as soon as I gave them to her, I realized, 'Well, gee, what are we going to use when we go to get water next time?' And then I woke up.\n",

I was with other people unrelated and we all seemed to be going somewhere but I don?t know where. The people seemed to be 20?s or 30?s of mixed sex. I kept getting lost and going up or down the wrong staircase. They were very narrow and gloomy. Sometimes there was a door at the top or bottom which would open into a variety of strange placesrooms and I would get frustrated at being lost, even though I didn?t know where I was going. At one place the stairs became very dark and I was either in a basement of an old warehouse type building or an old stone building similar to an old castle. The stairways and corridors seemed endless. Often other people were scrambling along them but I didn?t know them. At one stage a passage way came out onto a small beach surrounded by steep rocky cliffs. I looked around and discovered the others had disappeared. I felt very lost and alone and was starting to get upset. I think I came to at that point.\n",

I think he might have a beard or razor stubble but I'm not sure. He asks me something about my involvement with Wilgespruit or with Dale and Tish and I answer something like, 'That was the first place I'd ever found a home' or 'I'd never had a home until I met them' or something like that. At this point in time this guy does not seem that curious about me but I know if he knew about me and about how deeply involved I was here he would. there is a black man here it might be that this man is black. there is, in some other area near here, a museum, that has a lot of china, procelain sic, like tea. sets, teacup sets, it seems to be a place where only white people are allowed or that reflects something or represents something about a cultural practice that was only of white people. The other guestsvisitors who were at Wilgespruit are going into the museum, the man he looks like two indeciph. Words I think is functioning kind of like a tour guide or program coordinator he is kind of hanging back, letting the others go in, at first I am curious to go in but then I realize andor decide that that I do not want to join a museum that is focused only on white people i. e. I decide this as a matter of principle So, I stay back, and am near this man, he is going to get something to drink or eat in a cafeteria nearby, he's not focused on me and not noticing me in the way I am him i. e. , he thinks I'm just one of the participants, he does not realize that I have a long history and connection with Wilgespruit. Earlier in another part of this dream I get an idea for something exciting and worthwhile my idea was to offer T. groups by NTL at Wilgespruit in South Africa. people will want to participate, even if something like T. groups now may exist in their university or in some other setting, people will want to come to the ones at Wilgespruit because of the history of the place and how special the place is. And I get the idea that if we do it in the summer, we could publicize the T. groups widely to South Africans who now live in Israel people from South Africa who live in Israel now, because they tend to come back for the summer when they are on vacation from university and two indeciph. words and for these folks, to be in an interracial T. group at Wilgespruit would be very meaningful and appealing because while they were growing up they never had the opportunity for that type of experience i. e. they grew up in segregated South Africa. As I tell people about this idea people from NTL mostly, and also people from Wilgespruit they two or three indeciph. words\n",

I have to be careful of stepping so I do not stumble over anything. At some point I give the swim team kids a speech about how swimming builds up your body, gets your whole physical organism going. it's a powerful state of being you generate by becoming a good, fit swimmer, and you should appreciate it because it will last your whole life. A few kids hear my passion, and get it. At another point a woman gives me a mix of plums and other fruits. I try it, reluctantly, and it's ok. Then we're in a car, I have some plums, just as a police car is on our right side. oh oh, Will they stop us?. I'm worried. But no, they just drive on.

I also yell for everyone in the house to come look, be alert, possibly ready to flee or get to safety within the house. but then there are no twisters for a while, just strange wispy clouds. some people are walking through our back yard, like it's a through. passage for a trail. as the twisters approach, threaten, we all joke about whether or not we'll help these people. the assumption is of course we will, but I'm trying to make light of an anxious, uncertain situation. I say to a bald, healthy looking man, we'll make sure to take you. it all seems OK. then one huge twister forms, like a massive tree trunk, on the flat land below our house. I can see it moving across the land, not doing as much destruction as I expect, but still huge and scary. it seems to be moving slowly to the north of us, but if it suddenly turned our way, it would hit us in just a moment. fortunately it does not. but almost. then I go to the front of the house, which is very different from usual; like we're on a narrow, wooded, uphill street.

      "587 Last night I was having a dream that we were in the green truck. We were coming home from some kind of a long trip, either from my relative's home town or North Dakota or something. And we were going through my home state and it was the last day we were on the road. And you know how you'd enter my home state and you're, 'Whoo hoo,' you're in your own state now, but then it takes like a whole other day just to drive through my home state. And so we were in the truck and we stopped up in north my home state, and it was kind of up in the northeast corner of the state, I had a feeling that it was. And we were walking around this beach kind of area, and I kind of had the feeling that it's like Celine's house. It was close by her house, because we were on the beach and then there was this like garage that was backed up to the beach. And we wandered in and we were like wandering around. And there was like this person, like a staff person that was real friendly and sort of talking to us. And, you know, I cannot remember anything that was said. I just remember being there. And I remember the person, the staff person was real friendly and invited us in, and had us walk around and look around and was going to introduce us. And then there was this other like woman, this woman staff person there who was talking all about what it's like to be pregnant. And I said to her, 'Well, she must have had a hard time walking when she was carrying twins. ' And she's like, 'Yeah. ' And then we were sitting in this dark living room. It's funny because in the pictures from the  interview, everything was light, but in my dream everything was like dark. And we were sitting in the living room and Celine came out. She was wearing black. And Rene was there too and he was wearing black. And I cannot really remember much being said. I think Mom and Dad were talking about their trip and stuff. And then I think we were going to walk around and kind of have a tour and then we were going to see the back, which has the pool and the beach and all that stuff, and I remember for some reason next thing I knew we were going back on the road, and we were walking down this long, long dirt road back to the truck. And Rene, the older man Rene, was like wrestling with me and running after me in a kind of fun way, kind of playing, and we were down in this like ravine type of thing and we were wrestling around, and then next thing I know, we're back in the truck and I said, 'Well, where is this place?' because I kind of sort of knew that it was called Admiral's Cove in Jupiter. And so I was saying to Mom, 'Where is this place?' and she was pointing on the map that it was up in the northeast corner of my home state, which was kind of odd. And all the stuff kept happening. I think that the tires on the truck were just like worn out or something and Dad was like, 'Well, we're going to have to take the streets the rest of the way home instead of the interstate. So anyway, I thought like, 'Oh, brother, this is going to like make the trip like twice as long and I'm going to have to sit and ride like twice as long and I'm good and ready to get home. ' And it was not a problem, they did not have an argument. But something happened that Mom was starting to drive and Dad was in the passenger seat to my right, and I was like squished in the middle. He kept having to stop and get out and stuff, I think checking on the tires or something. And Mom put the radio on and she said she was listening for traffic reports, but there was some nice smooth jazz on. And then I woke up. That was really weird.\n",

      "588 Last night I was having a dream that we were at the Pizza Factory and it was just closing down, and they were having some kind of a closing party or something. And I can remember we ate pizza and were listening to the organ. But it was a lot more wood around  wood floors, wood on the wall, wood tables. And for some reason Dad was supposed to come back and help the people close the place down. He was going to like move tables and take stuff off the walls and everything like that. And so I came back too, thinking that I could kind of play the organ while some of that stuff was going on. And I was up in the organ loft. In this dream the place had an organ loft up in the back where the church would have, instead of having it out front on the lift. And so I was up there and I was at this light wooden organ console that was kind of plain, and it was a horse shoe console like a theater organ, but I was going to play it like a classical organ and practice for church this week. So I was trying to figure out not only how to put the stops on, but how to navigate and get the different people's memory levels so I could get different already pre. programmed pieces. And I had this magnifier and I put it out on the little drawer to the right, and there were like all these weird little buttons and things, but I could not figure out what they were for. And I turned it on and I started to play, but it was really, really weird. There was this solo reed stop on the great manual ? and I was trying to play chords within it, and, of course, it was awful sounding. And I did not want anybody to hear that, but yet at the same time, I wanted to let them know that I wanted to play. And then next thing I knew there was like this school tour group coming through, so I decided I would get down off the organ bench and let them have a look at it and stuff. And then the tour guide  all the students left for some reason and the tour guide was wanting to take me back to where Dad was. And I was trying to tell him I'd like to play the organ. And so I think he said, 'Well, we're going to take all the wires out. We're going to undo all the wiring, so you're not going to be able to. ' And I was like, 'Alright. ' And just about that time I was holding his hand and walking down the hall, and I heard a fire alarm go off in another room, and I like, I fell down to my knees just because I was startled. And I said, 'Can we please go outside?' And he was like, 'Well, you cannot go down the front stairway because it's blocked. We'll have to go down the back stairway. ' And I was like half running and half falling down those stairs. It was like round, round and round; it seemed like they would go on forever. And I remembered I had a conscious thought in this dream, I remembered how in a Bach fugue, you have a tierce de picardy ? you and you have a major chord at the end, and you have some material leading up to it if it's in a minor key. So I thought, 'This is just a dream; I really do not need to be afraid in this dream. ' So I was thinking, I imagined the sound in my head of material preparing me for a major chord ending to a minor piece. And on the major chord I pictured myself outside, and then I woke up.\n",

      "2. I'm traveling with Dr. Martorella, the travel requires that he and I each get onto board a small plane; as we approach, he gets onto one plane and I get onto another. I am holding some sort of file or chart or folder file folder under my arm. possibly also I may be holding my laptop but I do not think so. The rest of my luggage is in the luggage pile, or luggage area, of the plane, not in my arms. As I'm in my plane, I can also see the plane that Dr. Martorella is in, in the sky. I see it make a loop. de. loop, it makes me nervous because it seems an odd thing to do and it does not look right and also, I'm confused because it's not clear whether the plane is doing the loop. de. loop on purpose or by accident. Then suddenly it does another loop. de. loop, and now I become scared because I realize that something is wrong with what their plane is doing. Then I see the plane do a third loop. de. loop, this third one is quite wobbly, the plane wobbles and shakes, and I feel scared because I realize that the plane Dr. Martorella's plane is going to crash. Sure enough, a moment later his plane crashes. I feel scared. The passengers on my plane and I somehow are on the ground safely, and we rush over to where the other plane has crashed. As it was a small plane there were only about 6 passengers on it or 4. 6. We hear some moaning and groaning, and we have the impression that everyone is alive, and that people's degree of injury varies, ranging from less serious to more serious. The people seem to be mostly lying on their backs. I feel slightly torn about whether I should go up to Dr. Martorella to offer my assistance, compassion, and support to him, because I realize that since he is my doctor physician, he may not want me to see him in this compromised, vulnerable way, he may want to preserve his role or his image with me. But on the other hand, I feel that in this situation, the importance of showing compassion probably trumps that. I approach, and I get the impression that although Dr. Martorella is wounded, he is not too badly wounded. Something about the force of the other plane's crash caused some minor damage to some things that were on our my plane too, and one of those things is my folderit now seems somewhat bent or damaged in some way, not too indeciph. but still damaged indeciph. Also there is a possibility though I'm not surethat my silver laptop might be a little damaged. perhaps a result of touching down suddenly Now Dr. Martorella and apparently some or most or all of the other passengers is in a hospital room. He is still in shock more or less, but he is starting to understand. I feel very aware, at several points, that I could have been in his position, or even worsebecause when he and I approached to board the planes, we more or less randomly just each got onto a planehe onto one, I onto the other. Thus, I could just as easily have been on the plane that crashed, and this realizationawarenessthought is very anxiety. provoking for me, it is the main source of my anxiety. also, I feel aware that if I had been the one to crash, I might not have fared as well as he and the others seem to have fared, because of my heart history and my vulnerability related to that. It seems like he is going to be okay, he has broken a few ribs or something like that. I have the thought, and I may also say it aloud, that most or all of those injured in this crash will have to accept the fact that they are likely to continue to have some effects or some difficulties for the rest of their lives, as a result of this crash. For example, once your ribs have been broken or your back injured etc. in a crash like this, you are never going to feel totally normal again, i. e. , you are never going to feel like you felt before. I wake up feeling intensely anxiousvery, very anxious. awareness that I could have been badly injured or killed, that it could have been me, I might have been on the plane that crashed instead of on the other plane. hungerparathyroidwhat controls hunger? pituitary?\n",

      "339.  Drunkhungoverhighbinge drinking  This dream was long, intense and vivid. My parents move into this big new house that the people before had left many things. Most of it was all left on tables in the driveway. I was going through it and took some things like a cool old dress and 2 old doctor's notebooks. There were tables, beds, lights, clothes, etc. Chris Richards' dad dropped us off at my parents. He came in to say hello and met them. My mom was on the phone and with some other woman ignoring me, finally my dad came out to say hello. I had a job at some fabric store where I had developed many regulars . one an older sassy black lady. Nash G. worked with me. During a shift we were competing in a game. I wish I could remember how you played. But we would total up points at the end. Hazy  we were driving my car, stopped along the side of the road for some reason. Then in the distance could see a huge wave coming. It hits and we could feel water droplets from it. Then we see another wave come, this time it hits us and we panic. I ask Nash what to do. He grabs an umbrella from my car. We hold on to it and just float upwards in the sky watching the chaos below us. We come back down after the water is clear. I get in my car and drive to get out of there. We are on a road by the ocean. It happens again. But a bus hits my car and gets stuck underneath, but the bus moves. Hazy. The waves are still going on, but now I am in Kansas City in the winter driving to the doctor with my parents because I have to get examined. It has a hot second. We have to leave but the flooding was there also. We had to wait. I would sit and watch all the water go through the trees. It was very pretty. Hazy. The last thing I remember is laying down with Sparrow and having a 'movie kiss. '\n",

      "I was on a planet ? probably not Earth ? I and someone else I knew in the dream, we?re in a war situation, we get into a two sitter spaceship and we fly out to another vessel like a space station ? it was an orbit around the planet and we were nearly there and someone on the orbiting vessel operated a suction device aimed at us and I have a sense I know who it is that?s operating it and they?re on our side but they?ve got it wrong as to when to operate it, there?s a slight sense that while I?m frustrated I?m not entirely surprised that they?ve made a mistake. The canopy on the vessel I?m in breaks away and is sucked up, I?ve got lots of bits of stuff that gets sucked into the orbiting vessel, including stuff that was floating near the vessel. From our ship our dog is sucked up and I?m concerned that he might hit against some of the other stuff in the stream being sucked out or he might hit his head on the edge of the hole he?s sucked into, and there?s a vague sense that he doesn?t get hurt as I don?t see him getting hurt, then there are several other small living creatures from our ship all the same species, the size of a hen, not sure what they were, I knew though in the dream and wasn?t surprised they were on board, then I and the person with me are sucked into the orbit vessel. A bit vague, I?m inside, it?s a high. tech built station or vessel, the two of us plus other people who are on our side, I?m leading a running fight, we move through the ship and fighting as we go and we?re holding off the enemy, we?re hosing them with liquid from hoses attached to our backpacks and the liquid is Channel and I have some uncertainty about how or why it works so I?ve been spraying it across the corridor back and forth and I deliberately experiment it by holding the hose directed at just one person and they collapse, possibly die, and I feel regret about that and some of those we?re fighting are humans and some are waist high yellow robots and my spraying is effective against them as well. Some robots are on our side and one of the enemy robots comes up to me and stands beside and either I or someone on my side has been nice to it so it will be loyal to us and fight for us. The enemy seemed to be spraying us with a liquid but I don?t seem to get hit or affected by it. We?re trying to get to the leader of the enemy who?s a woman and her main cronies and the passage way leads us to an opening which is like a cave with stone walls not built and it?s possibly open to the sky at the top so my feeling is that we?re on a planet. My sense is that they?ve arrived recently and materialised through some sort of magic, she?s dressed in black with red accents or symbols and she?s possibly the incarnation of a bad goddess, she one of the pantheon ? I know this because this is a variant of a previous dream ? she and her cronies are performing a ritual and she explains to them and has diagrams and pictures as well that there will be a black button and it may appear in one of three states ? one is where it is just slightly raised, one which projects quite high and I?m not sure what the third one was. She explains what would happen if it?s pressed for each position and I?m slightly confused as to which does what and she?s very confident that a particular one will appear and that she will press it and be reconfirmed in her role as the incarnation of the bad goddess and I?ve a sense that this will make her even more powerful and that she will defeat us. A button appears and it?s fully raised quite high, I?m not sure what it does and I wish out loud that I had a copy of the diagram but there?s a general wish towards it and I push together with the others to try to get to it because I want to stop her from pushing it. I get shoved, I lose my balance and I land with my hand pushing the button. Next thing I?m standing a short distance away on a platform ? I have a sense of being elevated ? and I?m wearing the black and red armour so I?ve become the incarnation. As I realize it, I say ?oh, no!? and I?m briefly dismayed that I?ve become evil but then I think that I?m still me so I can choose how to act and I won?t be evil so this situation is a way of neutralising this power. I order everyone to hold fire and there?s a sense that I expect my people will obey me because I?m still their leader and her people will obey me too ? not sure if it?s because I?m now the incarnation of her or because I?m very powerful and they might be afraid of me. I issue another order, again it?s a good order, but my manner is very autocratic and I thought that I?m becoming like the person she was and taking on the attributes of the bad goddess and I?m concerned about this because it has threatening implications for the future.

      "2. a lion or lioness Iwe are somewhere in Africa, I think staying in a place that looks like a lodge or outdoorsy type of place There is this lioness, I've seen her, around, and I am afraid that she might come toward us and if she does, I do not know how to protect myself from her For ex.

      "I'm at a baseball field, standing in the third base dugout, and a pop fly comes my way. A guy catches it for me and gives it to me, he knew I wanted it. I've never caught a foul ball before. But I realize I'm in nothing but white briefs underwear, which are riding up my ass. In the other dugout are a bunch of A's baseball players, and I duck into the shadows with the ball, probably too late for them not to see me. I'm embarrassed as others cheer the play. Earlier, I'm sitting at a table with guys who came at 11 to check out the house for inspection. I was downstairs, and realized it's 1117, I'm late. At the table, like at a restaurant, a waitress brings a plate with leftover pastries. I try eating one with blueberries. dark purple in color. it tastes pretty good. At another point I'm driving into town from a house or campus, and I think I know where I'm going, but it turns out I don't, I'm lost. I drive into the left turn lane to make a u. turn. I have to be careful because a police car is in the traffic right behind me. nothing happens, though, I'm fine. At another point I look out the window of an apartment to see what the commotion is. I heard angry voices. I see people below in different apartments, in an alley, on the street. I'm not sure what's going on, but I have the feeling people are agitated in society generally. Then, I see a photograph of a preschool class, a nice little scene. kids and adults in the room, filled with toys, paintings, etc. I see a poster of California on the wall, I made it?. the characters in the photo are moving a bit. I see a child in a woman's lap, they move a little. the woman is Kerri from Bridgestone?. it's weird how the picture moves, I observe it closely to try figuring out how it does that.\n",

      "346. I have moved up to northern California, or maybe it was Seattle. I go to a new high school. It is huge! I pull in and park in a parking garage to find an entrance to the school and go to classes. I hardly remember them on what I took. The school had a very nice architecture. I do remember one of the classes being with a bunch of girls, one kissed me. Okay, so school gets out and I go back to find my car. I cannot for the life of me find it. I keep looking and looking and along the way and I run into Andrew my old friend from high school. He is with some other nice guy. We talk and they help me look in multiple garages. As we walk we ask a teacher to tell how to get to one in the distance. She gives us a long list of directions. Andrew helps me. I get there but it is crazy. It's regulated who goes in. I made it. You are on a moving sidewalk in line with tons of other people going up and up. You can see a beautiful landscape all around you, flowers and stones lining the trail. People would try and push you off. You had to stay on. I eventually get back down to the other building and start looking. I ask a woman for help. She gives me a little black machine, but it does not help. As I keep looking I come across a man. I ask him for help. But he is mean and starts to yell and wants to fight me. Someone helps to pick up me up while I kick him in the face multiple times and get away to keep looking. I hear voices, someone talking about a girl. I look up and it is Andrew and the guy. We are excited to see each other again. I kinda liked Andrew in the dream I kinda always have. I eventually find my car. I am so stoked by this. It is after dark but I do not drive home right away. I am with Andrew. We are holding hands, then the lights go out. He starts to make a move on me and then I wake up.\n",

      "615 I was up most of the night sniffing and snotting and whatever else because I just could not go to sleep, as stuffy as I was. So when I finally did go to sleep, I had this dream that was so very real, it was kind of scary. It was not really scary, but, you know, I dreamt that Mom and Dad had come back already and it was Saturday morning. I dreamt that, I do not know, I guess they just sort of showed up and I saw the truck out there, and I said, 'Well, why did you come back?' and Dad said, 'Well, because I drive too slow. ' And apparently that must have been what they were arguing about. And apparently also they had forgotten some things. Apparently there was thing that you would put your feet in and have them washed or massaged or something, and they had left it here at the house and they had intended to take it with them. So it was probably going to be a few days or more before they left. And I was really disappointed because it was not even really sure that they would leave again. And I was still, I went through a couple of phases where I would wake up and go back to sleep, and I could not really be sure that it was actually a dream until I really woke up and it was daylight. And I looked out the front and the truck was not there, and then I was really sure that it was a dream. And also I was having this other dream about being in the school someplace. And it actually kind of looked like the pier. Then I could be there for one or two classes and come home. And actually I did not even really feel like I was attending any classes. But I was rolling around and they had this roof top place like the pier does, and like I understand the hospital does. And we were out there with a couple other students and there was a white board, and the students were writing what they would like to see, up there on the white board. And  were talking about a recording studio, and I just stepped back and thought to myself, 'Well, surely I will not get into it because they people will. These people are kind of h people and they're like they're just going to hog it. ' And then I dreamt that for some reason I was swimming in this indoor pool, and when I got out, I was naked. And I was kind of running around in a quasi locker room, and there was this guy in there and I was really embarrassed. And he was trying to help me find something, maybe some food or my clothes or the right place to go out or something. And then I woke up.\n",

      "Rita Andrews or a woman who reminds me of Rita Andrews is speaking. She is in front of a group of people, and I am in the audience, in or near the front row. I feel engaged in what she is saying, enthusiastic, and I make some sounds like 'Mmmm' to show my agreement and understanding, almost like a kind of 'call and response' type of thing. We are in Bethel, I think. We are at NTL, I think; and Rita is talking about something connected to NTL, something like about what NTL has meant to her, and related, too, to what NTL's being in nature has meant to her. She's also alluding to what it has meant to her to do various programs that indeciph, which she did over the years. She says something like, 'And each time, during those 4 hours of driving to Bethel, I'd have the opportunity to mentally prepare get ready for the process of being in Bethel and enter into whatever the work was going to be about, because during those 4 hours or so there was nothing else to do, nothing to distract me, nothing but to gradually enter more and more into the space of getting ready to be at Bethel', I understand that what she is trying to say or suggestwhat she is alluding to is that the ride to Bethelthose 4 hours or so is a period during which there are fewer and fewer distractions, and she or anyone gets further and further from the urban areas and the areas where there are other people populations centers and more and more into areas that are not populated. As she is talking, I visualize the nature of the drive, the nature that is visible during the drive, in particular I see pine trees, and pine needles, It's like, I can visualize the nature that she or anyone sees along the route while driving to Bethel for those 4 hours or so, and I can visualize or imagine how, just as she is suggesting, that process of driving to Bethel traveling to Bethel helps a person prepare for the time that they will spend in Bethel. That is why, as Rita is speaking, I am kind of saying to her 'Mmm' at times, like, in an affirming kind of way, almost like the way audience members in a black church will say things like 'Mmm, yeah sister' while a black preacher is preaching. Part of what Rita is talking about or alluding to has to do with T. groups, i. e. , being in T. groups over the years, and part of what she's talking about or alluding to has to do with being in the Weirlab, i. e. , the self. differentiation program, and part of what she is talking about has to do with other NTL programs she has done over the years, but I mostly get the feeling that she is alluding to personal growth programs, or at least, the personal growth aspect of the NTL programs thath she has done over the years of being involved with NTL. I get the feeling that her speech might also have to do with the fact that NTL is on the verge of closing or is closing or is at risk of closing, and so, she is using this timeor taking this timeto think about what being at NTL has meant to her. As she is talking, I have the thought, 'Wow, NTL has existed for about 50 or 60 years, or maybe even indeciph more than 60 years, and now it's going to close', it makes me feel an awareness that if NTL does not survive does not continue to exist, we are losing a precious valuable resource, a unique place and way in which to engage in personal growth work and a unique set of people. At the same time, I am aware that even though I want NTL to survive, I have not really done anything to help NTL survive, I've kind of left it to others, i. e. , others who are willing to do the work of helping NTL stay afloat, and I've kind of coasted along as a member, just reading the members' indeciph Email, indeciph NTL survive but not really investing much effort to help NTL stay afloat. i. e. , Yes, I want NTL to survive, but am I doing my part? As Rita is describing her drive to Bethel, the drive that she indeciph where she is coming to NTL Bethel to do some personal growth work, and as I visualize the nature of the drive, in addition to the nature, I also visualize another quality or aspect of the drive it is something like, that the further and further away from civilization she gets, the more and more I see the process or the route as one which is analogous to some sort of process of entering deeper and deeper into something, and that process of entering deeper and deeper into something involves solitude, or requires solitude increasing solitude It is almost like, a quality of going on retreat, or going on a retreat, going deeper and deeper into something, toward something, going deeper and deeper toward something, and in so doing, having to leave other things and people behind; almost like, paradoxically, at the same time one is going deeper and deeper into something, there is also some sort of phenomenon of paring or stripping becoming more bare or pruning or leaving behind certain aspectsthose that are more on the surfaceto continue entering further and further, deeper and deeper, into this other place, this place that is further along the path, and deeper, further inward. YesI have this sense that, somewhat paradoxically, as the person Rita, or anyone travels further and further, deeper and deeper, towards Bethel, he or she is also traveling further and further inward. I have a sense of something linear that, though linear, has the same sort of quality as a circumambulation or something like walking toward the center of a mandala or something like walking a labyrinth, image of 'two chains stuck together out of a square' comes to mind Circumambulation I have a sense of something like, that the process Rita is alluding to when she speaks of her drive to Bethel is analogous to the process people go through in a circumambulation, going deeper and deeper into something, more and more inward, and more and more toward something some sort of Center some sort of centermost point, like the innermost point of a circle or the centermost point of a circle the innermost point of a circle but linear, a linear process of moving toward something in toward a deeper place and away from other things away from the less deep place, away from the more surface or superficial place, and that also has to do with moving away from population centers and civilization and into a state of greater solitude increasing solitude, something like a quality of becoming more differentiated, like, emerging from a mass, emerging from some sort of global mass, and, as one moves forward, becoming more differentiated from the global mass, and a kind of shedding along the way, a kind of shedding the more superficial parts and at the same time, a kind of emergence of the parts that were deeper or more inner more toward the center, emergence, and shedding, differentiating oneself from the mass, on a route or a path, or a road, toward Bethel, surrounded, on either side, by pine trees and pine needles I visualize all this as I sit in the front row of the audience, listening to Rita speak.\n",

      "619 Last night I had quite a dream. I dreamt that I was going to a conference of the National Federation of the Blind, and it could have  you know, when I think about it, it could have been the  or it could have been a theater organ conference. I really do not know for sure.  and apparently I had to leave from my city airport and fly to Charleston and then I made a connection in Charleston and then I would come back to my home state, I think, because it was in the south part of my home state. And I would rather do all that flying rather than ride in a car all that way. But  I did not know what city in my home state it was going to be in. And as it turned out, it was going to be in Honolulu, Hawaii, and so it was easy, yeah, the city was going to be Honolulu, Hawaii, but I had a feeling like the location was really a small offshore island, because I was in a taxi and we could drive there. And the taxi driver started going south and going and going, and I sort of did not think I was going to go all the way with him, and he really did not want to go all the way, because he said, 'Oh, that bridge, oh, my God!' But I was using the time to make some phone calls to figure out what the heck I was going to do, whether I was going to call Mom and Dad and have them come rescue me and say I had screwed up or whether I was going to call the people regarding the NSB or somebody was already going to be at the door . I do not know exactly how I solved this, but I think they gave me the name of somebody who was already going that way. And next thing I know, I was at the conference. And I do not know how or why this fed into it, but the city name of Honolulu reminded me of Lalalu, and I was hearing the version of Lalalu that was a duet between a man and a woman. And that was kind of weird. So I got the house. This conference was actually at a house, and this is what makes me think it was a theater organ thing, because there was a great, nice, nice piano and there were two organs, and they were electronic organs, but they had this little pedal board like mine has. And they were decent, they were not old analog, you know; they were not the funny ones. And this lady was there and we were sitting at the piano and we were getting ready to do a duet, and   bless his soul  was being so rude. He was butting in and waving his own music, and talking over us and just really, I do not know, just being rude. And then the conference was starting, and someone was starting to speak and  King did not want to sit down and be quiet. So the lady who was doing the piano duet with me and two other people kind of like herded him and escorted him into another room. And then I woke up.\n",

      "I am somewhere, in some other country I think or at least in some other state. I was staying with Janie in some sort of hotel room, I went out to do something and I told her I'd be back before too long, and now I cannot get back to our hotel room because I cannot remember the name of the hotel nor can I recall the location of the hotel. At first I think I'll figure it out before too long but then time goes by and now it's about 1030 at night and I still cannot find a solution to the problem, I cannot get to her or think of some way of reaching Janie. Also, I do not have a cell. phone, I cannot even phone her, but I think I have a phone  for her and if I could borrow someone's phone I might be able to. I see some sort of tour. group, I hear some of them speaking Hebrew, I guess they are Israeli, I hint at my predicament and there is 1 or 2 or 3 people in the group who let me use their phone but I still cannot reach Janiemaybe I cannot remember the phone  correctly. I feel sorry for Janie because I know that she does not know that she is in my thoughts and I have not forgotten her and I am trying to reach her, I know that from her own perspective she is suffering and she feels abandoned and alone. Re. the one or a few people whose phones I borrowapparently I'm not very considerate or polite toward them, because I am totally focused on getting to Janie and on my distress, so I hardly notice them or thank them for loaning me their phones. Then, I see Faith Matorin. She looks tall and lanky. Something about her manner reminds me a lot of a baby giraffe. I think Alrick is also around in this somewhere. I say to her something like, 'Faith! Do not you remember me?! I know you! We knew each other!' hinting at the fact that not only did we go to school together but also we were both on the same Israel trip when we were teenagers. But Faith, due to her having observed how I behaved with the other people whose phones I borrowed, or perhaps for other reasons, says No she refuses I'm shocked that she says No that she refuses I would have thought she would have understood my predicament indeciph. as a mother and indeciph. , probably 'respected me' as a mother, but text trails off page of space I feel panicked, desperate, fearful how will I reach Janie? the clock is ticking it's getting later She's going to be more and more frightened I indeciph. , probably something like 'ca not rely on anybody' for help I wake up anxious and afraid.\n",

      "629 Last night I had a dream that Mom was acting in a play at the Palladium, and I had the feeling that it was kind of like when she would do a dance recital, except she was not in a dance recital, it was actually acting in a play. I had no idea what the play was about or what her character was. I just remember being so excited for her and so thrilled, and I came along, and I remember being able to pretty much come and go as I pleased. The Palladium was about half full, there was some audience. So pretty much whenever I wanted, I could come out front and watch the play or go backstage and diddle around. I remember the backstage area was kind of a white floor instead of how it really is, and there were different dressing rooms and stuff. And I remember one time when I was backstage I was dancing with the other cast. We were holding hands and kind of line dancing. We were all backstage. And sometimes Mom and I would hang out backstage and she had a little while before she had to go on again. And then it was like an hour's worth of intermission, believe it or not. There was like a whole hour before the second half, and for some reason in my dream the Palladium was right next to the park, kind of where the baseball diamond is and where the t place is. So we got to walk around the lake and we were stopping at a water fountain sink. like type station to wash my hands and take a drink, I think. And for some reason she thought my face was dirty, so she was washing my face. And just about that moment there was a horrible horn honking and siren blaring going on, and she's holding by the face and she's washing my face, and I broke away and started running away. And as it turned out, it was not a fire truck or an ambulance or anything normal. It was some kind of a boat that was in the lake and it was from something called the Teddy Bear Foundation. And the Teddy Bear Foundation was apparently a halfway good organization that gave teddy bears the tour of the hospital, but they were also like Tea Party zealots, and what they were doing was they were staging a protest because they thought the Palladium wasted too much public money and was too much of a drain on society. And somehow I was able to jump in the lake and swim across the lake as a shortcut to actually walking around the rest of the lake. And then Mom and I walked through the place where the scoreboard is, where I used to hide in the bushes. We walked all through that area and cut across this field, and then we were able to get back to the Palladium on time, and I cannot remember any more of that part, but I do remember the part where we got home and Mom and Dad were fighting as per usual, and Dad was kind of wondering, 'Well gee, what were you doing there all that time?' meaning he knew that Mom was in a play, but what in the world was I doing there? Well, I told him that sitting backstage in the wings I could actually see the play better from instead of sitting out front further away, and, of course, that was baloney, but it sounded good to him. And I listed all kinds of books that I had with me to read and stuff. And then I woke up.\n",

      "367.  sober!!  I am back in Missouri at my parents' house, really wanting to paint my ceiling blue. So I call up the couple, Emily, to see if I could borrow a ladder. I drive over to get it. There is a man who is very nice and helped us. A woman answered the door. Now my dad is there and driving us both back in my car to his. I am asking if he has ever been to the Sequoia area. We get there and there are a lot of people. He had brought other items for his girlfriend. I go downstairs to begin painting, but forget that I have my old room. Inside of it are my two old beds, posters and random items long with new items, like two big paintings. I am disappointed to have an old life with these items I wanted to get rid of. My dad and I brainstorm to paint the trim instead of the ceiling. We tape it off and do multi colors. I am working on that while the guy's girlfriend comes over and meets everyone. They get along great. There is a sky roof type deal that is connecting the main floor and the basement. It kept on bringing in noise. I tell them that I will return the ladder next week. My parents are acting super hillbilly and she gives him a wet willy. I say, 'Sorry, they are from Missouri. ' I am in a subway with Michael, Courtney and Joseph. I ordered a sandwich. They got my order wrong and would not let me change it. It was horrible service. Then they are giving people guitars? I am at my parents' house again lying in bed looking out the window but this time I am a little boy about ten years old. My mom comes up from the window and says that she has been smoking pot and she is sorry. I go upstairs this is a completely different house, no longer my parents', just unknown. It is a second story apartment loft place. Reminded me of John's in Chicago. There are writings all over the walls with dead fish saying something along the lines of missing forks. Now this was a prank I did on my mom. It was me or my friends. I leave and hop on what seems like a dump truck my other friend is on another boy my age, he works on television and we are in California, some desert looking place by the ocean. We go and park by a bunch of other dumpster looking cars. all blue, it is by a military base. It gets hazy. I make it back home and tell my mom about the prank, we laugh. Just remembered another part of the dream being with family walking through some busy part of the building. I see Brandon. We say hello. But then I stop to actually talk to him. We flirt and catch up. But them Emily comes and finds me because I have to go with my mom.\n",

      "I am somewhere, on some sort of trip. I might be with my mother but I'm not sure. There are some other people on this tripa small group, I think. I think we're in Afghanistan, and there is a sense that the Taliban are coming, and we need to leave this place, and we need to leave fast, particularly because when the Taliban reach here they would very likely kidnap capture me or kill meus, all the more so because Iwe amare foreignersexpatriates and they particularly target expats. There is a woman here, who is like some sort of tour guidea female tour. guide, like the sort who might work in Bwindi or in the desert canyons trip. She is urging me to hurry, to gather uppack my stuff and get goingwe need to get going. Something about that bag I use as a laundry bagthe light blue and white one, that is half solid and half netted, that bag is a major image in this My things are kind of scattered around, and in order to get going, I want to gather my things up and put them in this bag, but I feel some sort of inertia, I'm not doing it fast enough, the things are kind of scattered about, and that slows me down. I think Kees might be with meKees might be in this somewhere, I might have a fear of Kees being kidnapped with me. The group. leader is saying to me 'Come on, let's go!', and I'm also saying that to myself, but I'm still gathering my things into that bag and still have not left. In addition to being afraid of the Taliban coming, I am afraid of a few other aspects of the situation one, that even after we get started, even if this woman waits for me does not leave without me, and we start at the same time, I will not be able to keep up, because I cannot hiketrek as fast as other people can, and thus, the whole group, including even the leader, will be ahead of me I'll be left back kind of like what happened on the Utah desert canyons trip, Secondly, I'm afraid that this woman will go on without me and I will be left to find my way by myself, and I would have no idea which way to go I'd get lost; thirdly, I'm afraid that it will get dark soonnow it is dusk, and it's important to leave in daylight, before dark, because apparently after dusk it becomes much more dangerous and the Taliban are much more likely to come out oscuro but even though I know I should hurry and just get going, even if it means having to leave some of my possessions and not gather them into a bag, I am still moving more slowly than I should be for the situation we are in, I still feel a sense of inertia, I am still not moving fast enough and the group. leader is really frustrated with me, exasperated. Something about the situation reminds me of Mahdi army and the stories I heard about the Mahdi army. Also, there is a question of whether if Kees and I are kidnapped together, I would accept the possibility of being released without Kees, i. e. , released alone, while he stayed may be 'stays' in captivity, or whether I'd insist that we be released together. the song 'It ai not dark yet' but it's getting there by Bob Dylan comes to mind. The image of the laundry bag is really strong half light blue solid half netted white designed so that it sits solidly on the ground across the bottomi. e. , the bottom of the bag is designed such that it sits solidly on the ground, so that you can put it down and it will rest flat on the ground, and the top part is more loose, soft, and flexible, it has a string that you can pull to close it shut i. e. a string that runs through the top part such that if you pull on it you can close the top of the bag. It has, I think, 2 compartments, divided by a piece of cardboard. Sense of Mom's presence. possible titles include phrases like 'Left Behind', 'Fear of Being Left Behind', 'Fear of the Dark', 'Inertia' fear of not moving fast enough Also, when I'm trying to packget ready, the woman group. leader seems to feel some sort of frustration with me, and in particular with my style or manner of packing, i. e. , may also say 'as if' or 'that' I'm not moving fast enough, that my style or speed of movement is not equal to what the situation calls for i. e. , I should have just thrown a few of my things together and gone, but I'm trying to gather together all or nearly all my things, even some things that I do not need or will not need, she is frustrated with that I think one of them might be something like the indeciph. , probably 'pump' that you use to blow air into an air mattress\n",

She was skinny, fair skinned, longer dark hair with very pretty eyes. She was hot. She met me and was not thrilled, especially about my age. Also upon meeting her, I also met her daughter. It was never revealed if it was Chad's kid or not. I wanted to ask him but never got a chance. She was 15, cute, with blonde hair. We got along. Throughout the dream his ex and he would hold hands and kiss. It did not bother me. I knew she would be going away soon. I remember being on a crowded bridge with him thinking how good looking he was. His ex had a big empty black suitcase. We are on a plane going to fly to Japan. We all fell asleep on it and woke up to it begin empty. Found it so strange. Hazy, being back at the office type setting that Chad was working at. I go out to ride a very small bike with two other people cannot remember. This part of the dream is starting to fade. It had a stranger feel. Amber from my home state was in it.

Then he starts to go up a one. way hill going the wrong way. We make it to the top. I get out of the car and want him to come back. He never does. So I went into a house, similar to my parents', where I thought I was at. I got into the bathroom and set my luggage down. I go back outside and the house number is 4228, so I think I just needed to go back up a bit, but then I look around and realize that I am in a desert. I feel stuck. So I go wandering around the neighborhood. I come across a parade that is going on and make my way towards a house. Tino comes running towards me. I go inside the house and there is now a big, nice family willing to help me. I told the dad the mistake about leaving the luggage in the bathroom. He helps me. I start to look in a closet, that's when all of a sudden I am behind some glass case with another man who has a gun and starts to shoot at the dad. Multiple shots are fired both ways. Everyone is screaming. Both of them are dead, killed by each other. Then man drops dead right there next to me, then I am able to get out of the glass case. This was dream one.

I sit at a table. There is food ready, like in a 'pot luck. ' I think I see fried chicken legs but then I do not get to them in time, they look kind of like the way Kentucky Fried Chicken looks. Some woman at my table says something to suggest that today after this potluck, there is going to be a women's hike, like a day trip or even an overnight, women from this congregation or group who will be leaving from here and hiking in the mountains or hills and staying outside till the nighttime or possibly even till the next day tomorrow.

Janie seems comfortable, and I'm pleased about that. There is some question about whether we could or could not go along on the hike without having been prepared for it or having planned for it. There is also something about, something like, when I was at my table the round table, some question about whether I'd done my part or not, because, for example, I do not think I'd brought any food to the potluck, and I do not think I was doing much to serve or clean up, so, I had some senseor possibly some of the other people here may have communicated to me a sense nonverbally, of something like, that, I need to learn to be part of a community and to do my part, and my share of the work, and to give as much as I wish to take, and so forth for example, not just that I wish go to on a hike with the women's group here but also that I want to do something to help the congregation or to help the potluck happen for example, I could help clean up the paper plates and so forth, not just to come and eat the food and go.

I do not know her name, but she is tall and has long dark hair. We end up on the bed and she starts to caress me and I keep telling her that this is not my thing. She keeps telling me that I could make tons of money with this job and it's so easy. I tell her I am not interested in her or the business. As I get up off the bed to leave, I wake up. In the dream I am thrilled with my body, especially in the bra and panty set, but I am very uncomfortable with her advances. There were various stages of the second dream. In the first stage I really do not know where we are me and my husband. It is a very rustic area, almost like a camping resort with lots of trees and a stream. We are not married, but dating. He is talking about going snowmobiling, although in the dream, there is no snow. He says we have to find clothes outerwear and then get the sleds. We walk to a small rustic house and find a rack of winter outerwear. He helps me pick out an outfit. We are all dressed and ready to go. My friend C. comes in the building. We tell her our plans and she says she will go with us to get the sleds. I tell my husband that I have not been on a sled in a number of years. C. states she will go with him and bring back the sleds. He tells me to stay out of the creek as there are deadly fish in there. My husband and C. leave. I feel threatened Is my husband going to come back and is he going to be faithful to our relationship? I walk down to the creek to see the water. The water is very calm. I get closer to the edge and spit into the water. As my luggie hits the water, the water swirls and bubbles and I realize there are piranhas in the water. I am fascinated by them. I decide to go to look for food for the fish. I go back to the rustic house and there is now a small closet that holds some clothes all blouses. I find an old blouse that was my mother's and some food. I take the blouse and the food back to the creek. I shred the blouse in pieces and put a piece of food in each of the torn piece of the blouse and tie it in a knot, so it looks sort of like a bow. I throw each one in the creek and watch the piranhas devour the pieces that I made, while waiting for my husband and C. to return. They return with the sleds. There is snow. My husband instructs me on how to use the sled and we take off on the sleds. We are having a great time going up and down the hills and following the trails. We stop at a cabin that has a broken fence in front of the cabin. We knock on the door and Adrian Quinn the actor answers the door. We inquire about the fence and he says he was just going out to fix it. It was broken by someone driving through it. He went on to explain that he was very lucky the fence was there because it stopped the car from crashing into the house, which would have been far worse. I feel very comfortable with his warmth and generosity. We offer to help him. We all pitch in to fix the fence in front of the cabin. Adrian Quinn talked about the importance of fixing the fence and making sure it is strong enough to withhold any future endeavors. As I help to mend the fence I feel more and more at peace within as I drive in each nail. As I am pounding nails into the fence the alarm rings and I wake up.\n",

Everest base camp in Nepal, or similar hikes I did in other countries, e. g. , Peru, i. e. on the Inca trail, i. e. , stations along the way like in the film 'The Way', those mountains in the basque country that people hike as a pilgrimage or something like that, also, the first station reminds me of one of the places we stayed at during the trip to Uganda and Rwanda the mountain gorillas trip, a place that had no electricity or running water but that was nevertheless very luxurious and beautiful also reminds me of indeciph. words, something like 'when I was' in Jordan, indeciph. words trips I took in Jordan, day trips perhaps, like to the Crusader fortress, or other fortresses Anyway at the first 'station' on this journey, at the hostel where I'm staying a friend and I, or maybe two friends and I, or maybe a mentor and I female are staying we see a knife and some drops of blood on it the knife looks like a kind of lance, bent in the shape of an arched lance or almost something like a scythe note I first wrote 'sythe', then added the c to spell it correctly, 'scythe' see original dream. text for diagram something like that, it looks sharp and dangerous foreboding and there are drops of blood on it, the blood is not thick or bright red, it looks like watery blood, and a shade of red that is dulled, kind of like an off. red, almost like water watery blood that causes it to take a moment or two for the person seeing it i. e. my friends and I or anyone to really see that it is blood a bloody knife,. When we see this, we become concerned 'What is going on here at this hostel?', and I start to feel scared scared that someone is trying to kill me and I'm aware that there is a womana young woman who is staying here, and she is around, and she has the features of borderline personality disorder; since I've studied psychopathology I am familiar with the traits and I recognize the traits right away in her behavior. This young woman is around, and she is indeciph. being very mean and aggressive, Yes, indeciph. line We fear she couldor willreally come after meus my friends and me and harm us andor me. like, I fear that she really might cross that line, between verbal or attitudinal violence and real violence; she might not only want to kill meus but might really try to kill meus.

I work with childhood sexual abuse! I work with rape! I work with violence! Now I'm on vacation, this is my vacation, and I wanted to have indeciph. , may be 'some time away' I wanted a break from violence and from all the indeciph. words this is my vacation, god damnit! and she will not leave us alone!' There is some sort of mentor here I think she might be different mentor from the one who's been walking the stations with me, but I'm not sure, and she hears what I'm saying, and understands she might be some sort of supervisor or clinical supervisor. There is some sense that in my having expressed this, stated indeciph. , may be 'my exasperation', and asserted my rights, I may have contributed to some sort of positive breakthrough or shift in this situation or in this dynamic. Then, after that, as we continue walking, and I continue to fear that this woman may may be 'will' kill me and to fear the sharp instrument the bloody lance a part of me also starts to awaken to an inchoate sense of compassion toward may be 'for' the woman and indeciph. , probably 'understanding' and some sort of empathy for her like, an awakening a sense that she is suffering that she is the way she is because she is suffering that underneath all of her demandingness and insistentness, and fury and hatred and aggression, is a suffering soul, a frightened soul, a lonely soul, a woman who does not want to be left behind. image of the Rorschach TAT card of the woman running frantically, in a mountain area or a cliff, and another woman who looks like her and runs near her or alongside her or something, comes to mind. franticness the beginnings of compassion\n",

The whole area was very surreal. I am sitting enjoying the moment. Hazy, then I have two cats and two dogs and my family is there. We are going to leave. I go to get the animals, but Aunt Annie does not shut the car door in time and they get out. I am able get the cats and one dog; the other is lost. I frantically search for it. Now the area is a very run down old parking garage with mostly underground layers. It is filled with very sketchy Mexican people, but also some people like me my age. The dog is red. I am asking everyone. Going to all different parts finding other dogs but not mine. I am very sad, upset because of it. Hazy. I am on some sort of car ride going through Illinois seeing all sorts of different trains go by in a big open field area. It made me miss it very much. I feel like I was just with my mom. Oh yeah, while looking for the dog, people tell me to sing and hand me a megaphone and were parading me around. It was very large group of people my age. I wish I could remember what I was singing. Now my mom and I are in, I do not know, what seemed like a 'lazy river' in this floodstream just letting it take us where we need to go it is in a big field type area with all the trains. There are some things that start to float along the river with us. I notice in the back there was a dead body floating. I freak out but yet remain calm. It is a male, short brown hair, mid 20's. We grab on to his hand and take him down the stream. He starts to talk, saying hello and then goes back to being dead. It gets hazy.\n",

And one day, I forget to get her there on time or for some reason she misses the bus or I miss getting her to the bus stop on time, and then, I forget that I could just drive her there.

Rather than having her miss the whole day of camp just because she has missed the bus, we could have indeciph. , meaning was something like 'used the rental car' to drive her to camp, but I do not do that, because I do not think of itit does not occur to me as it should.

I am also worried about what's going on with my memory that led me not to think of the idea of driving her there indeciph. , meaning was something like 'when she' missed the bus.\n",

      "Dream 1. It was late and G. and I were watching movies. I said to him I feel like I'm on drugs. The world was out of focus and sort of spinney. I heard a noise outside and when I opened the door a gaggle of animals were in the garden; birds, dogs, bunnies, goats. I tried to shoo them away but when I went back inside two rabbits, a duck, a dog and a goat were in the hallway causing chaos. The cat peeped out from the corner of a wall with a non. plussed look. When I finally got them back out there was pee all down the hallway, thankfully on the tiles. As I mopped and got to the kitchen there were jelly like blobs on the floor, huge chunks that looked like aspic. What the hell was that I called and went to get the dustpan. Was that real or are we on drugs. Did you see them or did I imagine it? G. replied that he had saw them too. Dream 2. I was at a formal dinner and C. and W. were sitting opposite me at the table. C. looked awkward in a new dress and there were ten people at the table. They all started playing a hand game like rock, scissors, paper only different. I did not know the game so I gave them the power bird, slap one arm at the elbow and bird, and asked if that counted and was told no. W. and I went to buy smokes and as we went down a big hill the guy in front of us grabbed W. by the hand and started running lifting his feet off the ground, I grabbed onto W. 's feet and we were flying like the string on a kite. Forgot to tell C. how nice she looked. Dream 3. I was loitering out the front steps of a theatre where I had missed the opening night as we'd gone to the dinner. One of the actresses greeted me like a long lost friend and snuck me inside to watch rehearsals. The stairs went up not down and I wrapped myself in a blanket and lay down on the stairs to watch quietly. I giggled now and then and the actress shushed me. I heard a click and swivelled my eyes to see a reporter hiding behind a pot plant. He grinned and said You just made the daily . We went back to their onsite caravan for a glass of wine and a gossip and I apologised to the other 2 actresses for not being able to attend. The oldest of the 3 said she was retiring and I told her is she needed anything to give me a call. I still did not remember their names but they were Aussie actresses.

      "I was riding my pushbike and trying to get onto the freeway. I tried to get through the traffic lights but the police pulled up and said that bikes were not allowed down the ramp today. The rider beside me turned around but a young couple at the lights which turned out to be Nick and his girlfriend suggested I chain my bike up and go with them for a beer. I left the bike against the crossing lights and went round the corner to Nick's Mum's place. For some reason my handbag was full of coins and Nick said he'd change them for me when we got to the pub. His Mum asked did I notice the poster on the back of the front door and I looked to find a poster of Megan Fox. We caught a taxi and got out at this tiny little alley corner pub. I sat down at the beer garden tables while Nick and his girlfriend went inside to get the drinks. They changed my money and bought me a glass of wine. I stretched my legs out in front of me and was embarrassed to note that the top of my white bobby socks were a grungy grey. Everyone seemed to be looking and I got embarrassed and pulled the bottom of my pants down to cover them. There was a half full pool in the laneway, sort of a bottle shape with the neck sloping ever deeper. Nick's girlfriend would pop up every now and then and bail out a scoopful of leaf filled debris from it. I asked her if it was a communal pool and she replied Sort of. Next to the pool was a window enclosed ballroom and a woman sweeping dirty water and leaves into the pool. She was wearing a long brown dress with strange bobble like tassles down the side seams of the skirt. From the back it looked like she was wearing a bustle. She looked very sad and I said she looked like a jilted bride and Nick's girlfriend said she was then added So am I. Almost like the girl heard me she rushed up a stone stairway that ran along the sides of the room, I could see her through the windows. Everyone seemed very protective of her. They said we'd better go and I walked into the courtyard and asked the barman could I use the bathroom. Nick and his girlfriend said urgently we'd better leave and that there were no toilets here for my use. They vanished as the barman gave me a dirty scowl and crossed his arms to bar my way going any further. When I got back to the table they had vanished and my wallet was open and the story I had in my bag on the table. My wallet was full of 2 coins and a taxi voucher. I was sure I'd had 134 but it looked like about 30 now. The woman flitted past me like a moth and asked if it had a happy ending. Puzzled, a long time since I'd read what I'd written I glanced at the pages. She was sitting on a low stone wall near the pool so I went across and said yes she got married in Book Two. The girl smiled and all the patrons made ready to depart. She appeared to want to follow me on my way so we walked companionably up a driveway together. As we neared the top she staggered and fainted at my feet. I cried out and looked up to see a giant wooden giraffe come to stand over the top of her protectively. The landlord answered my cries and came to help her to her feet. When she looked at me again her eyes were made of wood with tiny dots painted in the centre to represent pupils. I left swiftly but did not know what way to go. I asked an older lady walking by, she looked back at the pub then said she'd show me and grabbed my hand and pulled me out in front of a bus. The bus bumper hit me in the head and I had a robins egg by the other side of the street. She let go of my hand and as I stumbled around a little dazedly she whistled for a cab, jumped inside and was gone. I looked around and saw a doctor's office. When I went inside there were all these people in black suits sitting at low round conference tables with books, bibles maybe. A guy sitting at an empty table looked up and said Yes can I help you. Dream 2. I was in some small town, vaguely African and the tall broad shouldered man I was walking with went into a small shop and some thugs followed him. I heard an altercation and ran to some terraces next door to call the police. He emerged from an alley with his arm in a sling. We had to leave the van park via an downwardly sloping dirt tunnel and our tour guide slang up steel crates like clothes baskets on the roof for us to hand onto. I descended with gymnastic grace and he struggled along with his broken arm. There was a dirt trail at the bottom with a concrete toilet block at the end and I was about to walk up it when I saw a brown bear cub. I stepped back and looked at the alternative and there were two black bears. I went to move away and the brown bear cub started following me and the black bears spotted him and gave chase. I screamed for help. I ducked into a front yard and pulled some sheets from the line and flapped them about to scare them away. It happened that I covered the brown bear cub for a second and the black bears left in confusion. The brown bear started to follow me and the people that owned the sheets came out and invited us inside. The bear followed. They fed us tortilla wrapped rice but the bear cub was now a tiny white leopard cub about the size of my hand. Soft, silky and purring. I had to leave it behind and I was in my companions limo. At his house he told me to close my eyes and led me to an ice rink. He went to get some music on and after I marvelled at the whiteness I followed. He was belting at the disc player that would not work. I said it does not matter and he pulled me into his arms and kissed me. His lips were flat and unyielding.\n",

I suddenly realize wait, if I really give those away, I will not be able to recover them like I eventually plan on doing.\n",

      "437. Being in a house of my own, small and quaint and had a big tub in the living room. I had filled it up with suds and candles, about to smoke pot and soak when I saw a barbecue roll by the window. I throw on clothes and bring it inside, excited to show Chad. He later comes over and likes it, but it had fallen in my bath water. I was sad because I wanted us to take one together. I am with my brother who was telling us how he fell down and passed out before, that happened again, someone saved him. I stopped to cry and hug him telling him how that made me feel. He wants to get better. His stomach and ribs were so tiny and enclosed, like he had an eating disorder, but I could feel his love. Chad and I are in the van when some fat black man tries to steal the van and us. He was very slow and made the mistake of leaving and I was able to lock him out, ended up we were in Hollywood and some producer wanted me to be in a show. It is known that I have a lot of money, I am way up in the hills and there are trees all around with hiking paths. It was very beautiful. Justin and I are talking to a real estate agent person, saying how we wanted to build big hotels and make it a party scene. We say no. it's for our dad and we want a little log cabin by the water source. As we finish I slide down a steep ground path back down, my purse is there filled with pot. I am back in my parents' kitchen talking to them about Justin and how I will do whatever he wants, but somehow along the way it turns out to be Richard. He and navy buddies are in town getting a nice hotel room on the top floor with a view, Spoon will be there. So I go with him 35 a night each. He and I start to drive through the desert, it is strange and deserted. We go the wrong way and turn around. We make it to the hotel and meet up with his buddies. Spoon had grown up a lot. We end up getting in an airplane or helicopter. I remember the view was incredible! It was an abstract interpretation of a western city, you could see whales in the water this made me tell everyone how I saw a dolphin out surfing. Then I started to get really nervous about being up high in a plane, but then I just told myself, 'Stay calm, there is no need to panic, what will happen, will happen and take responsibility for your actions. ' We get to the room and there is some sort of secret headquarters. An older woman is trying to hide it. Behind our room was one filled with mattresses you could buy. Some girl was telling me how worthy it was to buy one there, laying on one that was made up of shredded newspaper amazing. I was going to make my own bed out of pillows, so I did not have to sleep next to anyone else.\n",

      "3. I'm sitting at a table I think it's a square table large Sitting with me here is a man, older than I, who is an acting teacher or used to be an acting teacher, with a focus on Shakespeare Shakespeare coach. He seems to function as some sort of mentor. I think he's sitting across the table from me, to my left, but I'm not sure. Also at the table is a man, an elderly man, who has played a character in Shakespeare not too long ago may have been Lear I think it probably was Lear, though it may have been some other character e. g. , Richard III. He seems to be a very experienced actor, old and experienced. there is also, at the table, a younger actor who is also interested in learning, I think. And I am in some sort of coaching session here, some sort of Shakespearean coaching session, in which I am trying to say some lines from Shakespeare perhaps from Lear, perhaps from Richard III, perhaps from Richard II, and I'm not quite getting it right, I'm not giving it my all, or reaching deep enough inside me not reaching into my depths, and the coach is working with me to help me go deeper, and the old, experienced actor is kind of sitting there observing observing this process, of the coaching session indeciph. , may be 'I have thus far been in', the lines I am working on contain the word 'mortality', but so far I've just been kind of saying the word as a regular word within the sentences i. e. , buried within the other lines, as if it were similar, in import, to the other words in the passage I'm working on, but then, at some point, the mentor says the word 'mortality', within the lines, in a way that I really hear it, i. e. , in a way that leaves an impression on me stands out for me, and, once I hear that, I feel like I can now work on saying the lines with greater authenticity and depth than I had been heretofore. the older, experienced actor understands this, I think. the coach says something to me like, 'You have come indeciph. , the meaning was something like 'far enough that' now you can transpose the line, or in how you 'say' or 'utter' make these phrases your own and express what is in them you can adapt the words and lines indeciph. if you want if you do not want to use the word mortality, you do not have to use the word mortality, for example. but I realize that it is specifically by hearing the word 'mortality', and having the word mortality in this passage that makes me feel like I could take the passage to a new level, a level of greater depth,. And I tell him this; I say to him something like, 'Well, it's when I hear the word 'mortality' within the passage that I really start to wake up, to come alive, to be able to go further with the passage than I had been able to go before so I think I need to include that word, I need to have that word included. ' the coach understands or at least accepts andor is persuaded by what I've said, so he says something like ok, then go with that. the older, experienced actor very much understands what I'm saying, and relates to what I'm saying. At one point, the older, experienced actor then says the lines, just the way he said them in a recent production he was in i. e. , with the same tonefacial expressionintonation, etc. , and it is only at that point when I seehear him do that that I realize that I saw him in that role in that play i. e. , I had not remembered having seen the play, but now that I've seenheard him do this, and until I sawheard him repeat the lines, i. e. just now, the way he did in the play, I had not realized that I'd seen the play Then, after I realize I've seenheard him in the role, and seenheard how he did it, I feel more able to make it my own and, while indeciph. , may be 'learning whatever' I can learn from his way of having done it, and drawing on that to have a deeper and fuller understanding of the lines and what they're all about what they're saying, to also make them more my own and deliver them in my own way, make them my own, go further in the way I deliver them express what they are saying or meant to say as Shakespeare intended, with an emphasis on the word 'mortality' A sense of something like, 'Oh, I remember now I've seen this, heard this before I understand, now, what these lines are about, what this passage is about I understand more fully now. And now I'm ready to make the lines my own. Now, at last, I'm ready to go further than I have, to make these lines my own and to say them from a deeper and more authentic place, I'm ready to take my learning to a new level; instead of delivering them in a mediocre, unaware way, as I had been doing before, I'm ready to deliver them to say them with a new level of understanding, depth, authenticity, and passion. to infuse the Shakespeare passage with what I now know, to bring what I know to the passage. I think the character is a combination of Lear and Richard II. with Richard II included too, perhaps but I'm not sure.\n",

She welcomes me and shows me around, pointing out changes. They  management  told her to take down some paintings pictures so now the walls were fairly stark except for 2 paintings in each room. I said she could certainly put up another picture on one blank wall which still held a picture hook. We chatted for a while, then Deb said she had to go to work helping these young people. She separated easily from me, more focused than usual. Dedicated. I follow her with my eyes and see her motherly and comfortable taking care of a tall, thin boy. Maybe taking him to bathroom, I look away. It's kind of pathetic, unpleasant. So now I'll leave. I go down a narrow, possibly winding stairway but cannot find an exit. This continues on and on as I wind down, looking for a doorway or passage out. It's almost like I'm in a corn silo  or silo  going toward a cellar or bottom floor but nowhere is an opening. I look hard for even a vent or tunnel or tube to crawl through. Seems I meet up with a younger woman, one or 2, and ask for directions for a way out. She or they think there MUST be an opening, and indeed I keep trying to shove stuff a cloth or rag into a 4 tubetunnel to see how far it goes. But oddly there is no way out. In dream I'm feeling increasingly claustrophobic. I want out! Possibly the only way out is to walk back up and into through . way house where Deb is. But I have not figured this out, yet.\n",

I met my mom in a parking garage and her car would not start. I let her know I'd drive. We were supposed to be there by 2pm but we ended up getting there at 215. The host said that we lost our reservation so we would have to wait 60 minutes. I was pissed. Then somehow we were able to sneak in and get a table. I noticed how many available tables there were and did not understand why there was such a long wait. Then my mom disappeared. I went to look for her, and she was in this other room. The doors had kind of an opaque glass, so I could see some of what was going on. It appeared as if they floor was shifting, it kept tilting one way and then the other. Finally she came out of the room and made reference to it as if I had been in there before, asking me if I remembered it, etc. It did remind me of this weird haunted house I went into at Disneyland years ago.\n",

I was with a group of people, one including Emily, we are stopping in convenient stores. Then I am becoming more aware that I am in Chicago and became very excited. Emily and I walked down to the end of the street and you could see the entire city not how it really is but similar and every time I dream of Chicago it is very peaceful and beautiful for me. I am pointing out to Emily just beyond this statue is where I used to live. And to the right was a roller coaster down the way, but we went to the left. We are supposed to meet up with this older woman there. Somehow Emily and I end up with the van in some parking lot in some suburban area. We are lost and needed directions to the roller coaster. So we decide to break into a condo and use their things. I see they have a computer and get on it to start looking up directions to the roller coaster, but I am having a hard time typing and keep losing the page. Emily is spread out on the bed with all sorts of shells and rocks. I can tell that the owner of the condo is about to come back. I feel an extreme rush to pack up things and leave. Then on the computer popped up that it had been blocked. The man knew we were there from that. We make it out the door just in time. I am walking down the steps out as he is coming inside on the phone with the police had also made me a medical ID inside, I think we are back out in the parking lot. An ambulance is there loading someone up into a stretcher. I think about how it was good that I did not use the ID. We see it as a chance to leave. Emily wants to drive the van but I will not let her. I take it and let it roll in neutral down a hill. It goes on some side street neighborhood, something that looks more like San Diego. Then I think we hang out in the van with guys coming up talking, but the van had or was more like a box on the back with nothing but windows. We were happy to get away. Hazy. I was living in an apartment and had a ton of stuffed animals. I decided to get rid of them all and my two cats from childhood were there. '\n",

I grabbed an orange from the produce isle and peeled it for him and gave him half. Then he started bragging how one day he'll buy me a Bentley and he'll let me drive it as much as I want. Then he said his name will be under the ownership of the Bentley, and not my name, kind of like he was laughing at me. I then said to snap back at him, You could barely afford an orange, so how are you going to buy me a Bentley? He got quiet and I realized it was because he got upset at what I said.\n",

Later returning to where I was sure I parked my truck I could not find it. So I started to walk around trying to find it with no luck. I was really sure where I parked but was confused, where's my truck?, as I have to get back home to Boise by Monday to get back to work and it's a 14 hour drive and it's late on Sat. I was worried about my job were I not make it home. Then I remembered home but it was not where I live today but a house I lived in back in 1979 in another city and I was happy to be there because it was such a nice place close to the ocean and it was a bright warm summer day. When I awoke I remembered my truck was parked in it's normal spot and I was relieved.\n",

      "I'm at the Rose Bowl. I go there with some people, including a young woman I like. I'm a player. Some activities before the game. It's held in front of the San Francisco Bay, as if from the angle of our house in my town. As people watch the opening activities, I look out at the bay and see lots of water spouts and tornados. I'm amazed, and call out to people, that's just like my dream the other night!. I run to get my dream journal to show people, but I cannot find it. I'm telling two black guys who are players on the team about the dream, how this is exactly like it. Oh well, that's okay if I cannot find it. it's still a great synchronicity, a favorable sign for the game. At one point one of the tornados starts coming towards us. Right towards me. I try to figure out which way it's going to go, then quick take shelter in the shed under our deck. the tornado is noisy, and passes without harm. Then other people arrive, Bud and Fern among them. It's time to get dressed for the pre. game activities. I go to put on some nice clothes, I want to look good for them now I have some nicer clothes to wear. I put on a tuxedo?. I see a speed boat out in the water aiming straight for the shore and our house. He's going too fast, I go over to watch where he crashes, he shoots right into the house and comes to a skidding stop. He's okay, I'm surprised and realize that was an impressively dramatic entrance. A weird way to do it. Then the game starts, I'm a blocker on the offensive line. An older woman is quarterback. We line up, and she decides to change the play, calling out to the other players what to do. I see the clock running down, just a few seconds left, I'm afraid she will not hike the ball in time. But somehow the clock goes into extra time, even though it seems like it's run out there's still a little more left. The woman calls hike, gets the ball, and starts running forward. I block for her, push other guys out of the way, and she scores a touchdown. I'm so excited, I jump around and whoop and scream in joy. I'm bouncing around so much some people laugh at me. I look up in the stands, and not many people are there; many empty seats. At exactly the same time the girl and I say, where are all the people?. We had the same thought at the same moment, it feels like another sign of our closeness. I had been worried she was with another guy who arrived to watch the game, but she's with me. She says, in amazement at how few people are in the stands, You brought Thunder the cat to the game, but other people still are not here?. It's a good point. I think of seeing Thunder curled up in another room, with some white stuff around her?. like a circle of chalk. A bit earlier the other team tries to run an offensive play, a long pass, but the field is covered with a thick layer of fog about five feet high, so the receiver cannot see the ball when it comes to him, and he drops it. As I look around the mostly empty stands, I think of how our plane must have gotten in first, while others must have been delayed. I say Okay, they'll be here for the second half. We are up by two touchdowns already. At some point I wonder, how is it possible I'm playing?. Even though I'm older, I'm performing in this college game. Well, I think to myself, I never played for the football team before, so I still have athletic eligibility. I wonder if other people will be impressed by my athletic ability. I really like this girl, who has long red hair.\n",

      "Possibly out of sequence, possibly continued from dream 1. Abby comes outside maybe from school building where I've been awaiting her bringing me information to drive to new next school. She sits down to eat. She has fixed herself something which looks like a half of a chicken breast, but it is pink. It looks like raw fish, or lox. Turns out it was PARROT! Yes, she was sitting down to eat parrot which she bought packaged ready to cook. This bothered me on a couple levels, mainly that it was a parrot! But she's developed many new ideas about food and health issues recently. She takes a bite and it tastes or feels awful. She spits it out. She cannot eat it. I suggest  tell her  to take it back to store. Return it, get her  back. She's resistant, unlikely to do it. Does not want to bother, and possibly does not want to speak up, to complain. Oh, I'd definitely do it! I ask her how much it cost. She tells me  7. 99 but when I ask her to show me the clear vinyl package, there's a price sticker of 9. 99. She's partially removed price sticker maybe to fool me, maybe to make it difficult to return. But yup, it's gotta go back! She probably does not have receipt or does not want to give it to me, does not want me to speak up make a scene. But I will, you know. Even without receipt. No one takes advantage of my child! Not to mention the poor dead parrot. Even in dream I consider philosophical difference between eating parrot  chicken.\n",

At one point we're going down winding, twisting chutes or driveways, like at an airport parking garage. it's kind of fun, like an adventure. some of the portions of the twisting driveway are very smooth, and well painted in white and red. I have a clear sense that we decided not to take the fancy motorcycles, but the more modest ones instead. Apparently we stole, or borrowed without asking, the motorcycles we are riding. somehow it's less of a bad thing that we just took what we needed for transportation.\n",

I am aware that lila will be worried about me, she will wonder what's happened to me, but there is nothing I can do but wait. Finally, after a long while, the officer finishes checking on me, and then text trails off I feel aware that Lila will be worried. I do not remember whether in the end I reach her or not.

The woman sitting at the end, next to me, to her surprise she gets dunked just as we start out on the water. I help her process what's happening. As the boat nears shore I take off my pants with my wallet and phone in the pockets. I go to a house and call for Marcia; I hesitate for a moment, unsure if I got her name right, but I did. She's there, and takes my pants away to a safe place. I'm pleased I remember her name correctly. Now I'm on the boat in my underwear. Others see me, I wonder if they're thinking the teacher has a pretty good body?. Then, I'm driving on a two. lane road. There's a narrow part, with a small mudslide to my right and a pothole or ditch on the left. A woman is driving a small, modest car the other way, light blue?. I let her go through the narrow part first, but she does not see the ditch. Her front right tire hits it and pops off the car. She pulls over, and I drive past the narrow part so we do not get stuck there, then stop and go back to help her. Even though the people in my car want to keep going, are irked at me. It turns out she has no spare tire. Who to call?. I figure out what she should do next. Then, we're driving out of the resort, through an automatic check. out line. I'm not sure how to proceed.

Being with Jeff's family and being thankful for their house keeper. Vice versa. Driving Richard's car with him on a side railway by a science research center. I was very fascinated with my surroundings. I stop to talk with someone and start to slightly drive off the edge.

I am in a small house with my brother and someone else. He had locked all the doors and put a bomb by one of them. I realize that the house is about to blow up. I am able to find an open door as an escape, taking the bomb. I am outside during the day in what seems like countryside. There is a school bus parked outside with lots of items around. I get caught up in doing something. Then the bus is about to drive off with people in it. I run on to explain and get the bombs off, but it ends up going off as the bus drives away. It turned back to have neon signs and people were okay. I am in a downtown area, with lots of small shops, bars, restaurants etc. Monique was there making fun of me because I was in a part where all the fat, lonely gay girls go and some girl came after me. It is at night. I am with Andrew looking for someplace to busk; there are other street performers around in the same shop area. Later on I am with Monty in the same area, walking around talking. We go past a well know bakery for the area. I spend 7 dollars buying him a bag of donuts. Some businessman was interested in the bomb that I had, wanting to set it off in an office as a practical joke. Andrew and I are driving all along a coast area, Hawaii I believe, right at dusk. Such beautiful imagery. We had to turn around a few times. Also I was in contact with real estate agents about getting property out there, looking into alternatives.

I quickly park in the middle of the bridge, but realize that it is not the one. We begin to walk down into what seemed to be a tourist area into a big tunnel. It is a big locker room with a big space filled with multiple different beds, different sizes and colors. There are a few other people walking around as well. We go run and jump on the blue bed. It fades. Next we are back at my parents' house. Megan was there getting breakfast ready, making biscuits and gravy. We kept snacking, then Andrew kept telling me how he wanted to go back to Colorado. I honestly told him no, we are not going back because I do not want to. We spent enough time with his family. We need to go back to California. It is out of the way. I do not want to spend the money. The plan was to go to Northern California. He was down on the kitchen floor looking up, begging me.

She wanted to make an announcement and tell us that she was gay. Then she picks me up and starts to make out with me. Hazy. Then I have my orange backpack with all my clothes and books; back to her house with her husband. We are all walking on eggshells around him, hiding what we were really doing. I stay there, but then in a hassle we pack up, shoving everything in my backpack and sneaking out to the car. We are happy the food is still in there; we leave. Hazy. Next thing I know we are on top of a hill in a tropical area. We invested in a waterslide that went down and landed in the ocean. At first I went down it without knowing where it landed. Life guards are at the bottom waiting for us and swim back to shore.

This is all new to me. However both of the signs are hidden behind the bridge, so I have to drive up right to the split in order to see what's what. I finally see the sign on the right says Springfield  I remember seeing the word, so I go right. I recall feeling very intimidated as I drove up this ramp it went really high as they often do in my dreams  since I was new to this road. Once I went around the curve my car broke down. I pulled over to the side of the road. My car was no longer there and now it's a bike maybe it was a bike all along. Anyway the tire had completely come off the rim. This black van pulls over and this creepy looking man opens the door and asks if he can help. I felt a bit weird about it, but since it was daylight I said ok. Then a cop pulled up as well. However neither of them ended up helping me and both left. So I am still standing there alone, and another car pulls up. This time the guy wants to take my bike, and belongings. I try to hide my purse, since it has my phone but am unable to hid it from him. Eventually someone else picks me up, they happen to live close to my mom so I get a ride. We stop at his house and he has all these kids there, playing. He seems to start hitting on me, and I ask him Wo not your wife mind and he said no. Next thing I know his wife, a rather large woman, walks in and does not seem to mind that I am there. From there I walk to my mom's house, I remember seeing snow falling. That's all I recall.\n",

      "Something about via dolorosa. I am traveling in some foreign country. looks like it might be somewhere in Old Europe, like Italy or someplace like Italy. Malta, perhaps, too. maybe also some elements of Jerusalem I'm not sure. there's some sort of road I think it has a lot of stairs steps and it might be made of stone andor cobblestone. I think it has a reddish hue like Petrathere are aspects of it that remind me of Petra, andor of the color of the stone at Petra. rose. colored hue, sand stone I think it's in an area of Citadelsan area where there are citadels. It's like a path that involves walking upward some type of gradual ascent. It's fairly wide. Somehow as I'm walking on it, I learn that it's called the 'via dolorosa. ' And I think it may be the via de la rosa sic i. e. , the one in Jerusalem, that Jesus walked on not long before on his way to his crucifixion. As I'm walking, somewhere along the way I come across a woman and child they apparently live on this route or along this path, and I kind of stumble upon them they live near an area where there is some sort of water it's hard to tell whether it's a lake that's next to the house, or a flood i. e. the water levels rose so now what used to be a dry area looks like a lake. I think the child is a boy I think he's kind of swimming in the lake. His mother is an adoptive mother. Either the boy or the mother had indeciph, something like 'disclosed' to me somehow indeciph, something like 'that' he is adopted and that he had a different mother for the first part of his life maybe the first 6 years or so, and something happened to her she may have died and now this woman has taken over his care she may have been a friend of the child's birth mother, but I'm not sure. As I enter the area that is part of their apartment the area reminds me a little of that area of Jerusalem near the Old City Beit Hanina, I suddenly see a broader vista a broader view. It's like, there's some sort of picture window, and when I look out the window, I see a beautiful view that I had not before. a sense of a broadening of my view, a broadening of the view sense that Oh, this window was there all along but I did not see it. the sense or the quality reminds me a little bit of the sort of feeling one has when one catches a view of Manhattan from Brooklyn i. e. , the way that you can see Manhattan more fully and more clearly from across the bridge, in Brooklyn, than you can from within Manhattan. Only this view, from where I am now, has water in it some sort of body of water and some sort of shore, I think a sense of looking across to the other shore and color beautiful, appealing, rich colors, I think the window is contained within a framed area almost the way a painting would be I think it's framed by the window I'm looking through which is a sort of picture window. So, through that picture window, I look across and see the view at the other shore or on the other shore. I have some fears about whether it is safe or not for the child to be in the water like this while the adoptive mother has gone out the mother has apparently gone out for some time, and the child is swimming around by himself I am concerned about whether it's safe. But she seems to genuinely care about the child, and the child seems to be okay and to feel okay, happy, comfortable, at peace neither frightened nor grandiose about being in the water like this while his mother is out, so I have a tentative hope a cautious hope that it might be okay. Something about the child reminds me of the name 'Buffie' or 'Buffy. ' At some point I think the mother returns there's a sense that this house is located on the left side of the via de la rosa sic, as I'm walking up. There's some sense that this is a stop like a way. station and that after a while I will have to continue on my way, continue ascending. the view reminds me a little of that orange and blue painting that Mom liked, that one we saw at the museum the brightly colored one later identified as Matisse's The Gulf of St. Tropez Sense that I am gradually ascending. At some point I'm not sure if it's still in this dream or if it's another dream I see Lila. And I talk with Lila. a moat sense that the body of water that the boy was swimming in was a moat. Something like, I think, further along the path, I meet with lila, and talk with Lila sense that lila is in a house a spacious house might be some sort of condo, townhouse, or vacation home but I'm not sure I think she's in the kitchen area and it's a spacious enough kitchen area not huge, but not cramped either there is enough space for her to move around and get what she needs from the fridge and cook and so forth. lila looks content comfortable I'm sitting in a living room area, I think and I'm talking with her I think what I'm talking about is some insights I have gained along the way this experience of finding myself on the via de larosa sic and my encounter with the mother and son and the picture window 'we try we fumble we try' 'drunk and blind in our pleasure and our pain'\n",

Then I keep driving, and I bump into the back of a car in front of me. It's a storm chasing car, and I knock the guy's camera off the car. I say I am sorry, but I also feel he should not be stopping his car in the middle of the road. I get to the house, and I see lots of tornados forming off on the horizon.

I have to go to the bathroom, so I use a toilet that seems to be outside on the sidewalk. I take a shit, but it's hard to get it all the way out, and I realize I have to hurry or else the twisters will pass. I try to flush the toilet, but it will not work properly. I have to fiddle with the buttons, and finally open the tank to get it to flush. Other people are in line behind me, waiting to use the toilet. A mother and her child among them. I finally get out, and I go across the street in the direction of the tornados, into a wooded area that's also part of a wealthy person's house. Other people are there, sitting at a table, watching the tornados. It is getting dark, and I cannot see as much as before, but I do see a big one ahead, closer than the others. I take some pictures with my cell phone camera. In the sky straight above me there are cool flashes of light, like crackling bits of lightning. It is so cool and beautiful, I am super happy to be witnessing this. I wonder if I should use take video of this strange phenomenon; I wonder, has anyone ever seen this before?. Wow!. Earlier, I go to a house I have bought. I drive a car into the parking lot. I meet some people there, including a young woman, maybe she's 21?. We get talking, kind of flirting. We are sitting at a table with lots of electronic stuff on it, wires and gadgets, fiddling with them while we talk. She mentions how old I am, and I say yes, with gray hair and all. It's like we both acknowledge my older age, but it's not a barrier between us. We go some place together, and I carry her piggy. back style. I'm aware of her body pressing against my spine. Wow, I am pleased. That feels good, it's a strangely secret kind of intimacy.

Both houses are out in kind of rural areas away from the city. It seems like a modest area, low income, kind of run. down. I slightly worry about the tornados coming at us, but I feel confident we would be fine in our house. At one point I see a big tornado out over the water, churning up a big plume of spray. It's dark, night is falling, it is getting harder and harder to see them. At some point totally different I am in the water at a beach, and I skip some black lava rocks. The first one I throw goes surprisingly far. I am pleased by this. These rocks are lighter than others?.

I know that someone recently did a good deed for me, and I want to do something like that now. Earlier, at a football game, maybe a bowl championship?. A player scores a touchdown, then he jogs over to where Ronald and I are standing. We congratulate him, and he makes some funny noises. I say, as a joke, you sound like an animal. He's a big black guy, and he glares at me, and I realize with worry that he did not like that comment, it could have a racist subtext. but he lets it go, and we are nice to him. Earlier, I sit down in an outside class on philosophy taught by a young Asian guy with a heavy accent. I am a new student, and I have to introduce myself. He is okay with me being in the class. Before all that I am walking along a beach, and a floating mat comes sailing at a diagonal towards the shore, up on its edge, right to the spot where I am walking. Surprised, I reach out with my right hand to grab it, as if that's what it was aiming for me to do.\n",

We come to a house, and we go into it to look for something. We should not be here, I think to myself. Then some people drive up in a car. oh oh, I worry the people will be mad at us. I go to explain to them why we are in their house, trying to be friendly and unthreatening. But they do not even notice us. I am surprised and relieved. We keep going.\n",

      "I am somewhere in Europe, perhaps somewhere where I've ridden on some sort of trolley, I think. People from Meadowbrook Jr. High School are here people who knew me back then, when I was 11. 12 and thereafter also some from Newton South. Yet something about it also reminds me a lot of an experience of re. visiting the University of Maryland, years later or the people from the University of Maryland, years later in a spirit of maturity and forgiveness and compassion. Bob Dies is here. I am compassionate toward him. I ask him how Kathy is. Ray Lorion might be around but I'm not sure. Current. day students are around, and I have compassion for them too. Something about their quality or energy reminds me of the students in my Pace PsyD class. Aliza, in particular. I have a sense that the current students have heard about my UMCP case from all those years ago. And they respect me and are glad I'm here, they're curious about me. At a certain point, a woman walks up to me, coming toward me to greet me and embrace me warmly. She looks old, she has lines etched in her face. I recognize her immediately as Mrs. McDonough, though some aspects of her face also look like that of Mrs. McGregor. I greet her very warmly 'Mrs. McDonough', I say I recognize her, even though nearly 40 years have gone by. I immediately think of recall that moment in Feb. 1975 when she took my hands and looked at me and said 'I'm so sorry for the terrible tragedy that has befallen your family', after I came back from February vacation after my father died. Then it occurs to me, 'that was nearly 40 years ago. ' I feel a sense of warmth toward and connection with her, and an awareness that she knew me during some of the most formative years of my life, and an appreciation for the way that she expressed her sympathy for me at that time and acknowledged my loss of my father, and also an awareness that that was probably an important moment for her, too the moment in which she expressed her sympathy for me. I also feel a sense of compassion for myself as I was in those years, my 11. 12. year. old self, the 7th. grade girl who had just lost her father. I feel a connection with Mrs. McDonough at times she also looks like a hybrid with my first. grade teacher, Mrs. McGregor and I want to have time to talk with her further I want to really sit down with her and talk with her, about who she is as a person and what her life has been like. It occurs to me that if she's still working as a guidance counselor now, at this age and she is, i. e. , at age 70 or in her early 70s, then she probably needs the money, otherwise she probably would have retired by now. And I'd like to know more about her journey her life's journey, and tell her a little about mine, and let her know how much I appreciate text trails off And I want to tell her that it was meaningful to me that she expressed her sympathy to me on the loss of my father. But for some reason, we are pressed for time at the moment. I think we might be at some sort of event almost something like a reunion, or maybe on some sort of tour like, with a tour group. I feel there has not been enough time to really talk with Mrs. McDonough, so I want to follow up with her tomorrow, but we are pressed for time even to be able to give my phone number or my email address. I am going to text her my number or email address at first, but there is not time to turn my cell. phone on, so then I try to quickly write down my cell. phone number for her, but I write it so quickly that my handwriting is not legible she cannot read it, or at least it's not definite I have a sense that she is open to talking with me further but she does not feel as much of a need to as I do. Like, I really want to talk with her more and see her again tomorrow, and I have a sense that she may or may not follow through on contacting me. Now I am on some sort of trolley, or bus, something that feels touristy in some way. There are others on here too, like others from the reunion or group tour. The vehicle stops, and some people get off may be get 'out', and then it continues, and I have the feeling I was supposed to get off with those other people, at the same time they did, and hang out with them. Something about this reminds me of the area of the Anne Frank house in Amsterdam, that area around the Anne Frank house in Amsterdam. That's how the streets look. An image of Anne Frank comes to mind. Sense of wantingneeding more contact with Mrs. McDonough that the few moments of a warm greeting and embrace were not enough. In the way her face looks she also reminds me of Mikki Ritvo. lines etched in her face. an old woman. I think about how, when I tell about this experience to Lila tell this story to Lila, Lila will probably think about her own aging process, and the question about howwhen she will retire. a quality of lines etched in the face a face etched with the lines of age. also, that quality of the face reminds me a little of my grandmother, Gerty. nooks and crannies in the face. the phrase 'with the effort of making a soul' or 'etched, with the effort of making a soul. ' also, sense that in one image of the old woman she has dark hair jet. black hair maybe like Aunty Erma?, whereas Mrs. McDonough has white hair.\n",

A question goes through my mind about, when Kees dies someday, 'would I want to be given some of his ashes or bones mixed in with his ashes to wear around my neck on a necklace?' I realize that even though in some ways it is tempting to me to try to carry Kees around with me in that sort of concrete way, I do not really need to be that concrete Kees is with me in so many ways, nonmaterial ways, spiritual ways Kees is a part of me and lives inside me, always. Before that, there was something about I think about the time I learned that Kees had been in Pennsylvania and New England without seeing me and without telling me about it I realize that this is okay, that I am doing something similar by going to Switzerland without telling Kees or visiting Kees it is about the same number of hours travel i. e. , for Kees to travel to Switzerland to see me during this trip as it would have been for me to go to the places he was. Something about I see Loes. Loes may have gotten a text message or a phone message or letter that indicates to her that Kees and I had have? romantic or sexual feelings for one another I see her and I assure her reassure her that Kees loved her that when Kees was with me, he often talked with her and expressed his love for her i. e. , that even when he was with me, and even though he was with me, he spoke of his love for her and it's clear that he loved loved or loves? her. She understands this and knows this is true. there is that paradox that he could genuinely and sincerely love more than one woman at the same time.

In my mind's eye I see it as tapping with a finger. I run over, open the door yet instead of the bird coming out a walrushippo comes out. I know right away it's going to be a total pain to get it back in. It's crawling across the floor with other companions. The bird is still trapped but it is conveying to me that it will be ready next time I open the door. It sees my hand coming and swims toward the door through the water like a dart and then wiggles in preparation and when I open the door it shoots out. I anticipate and wonder what it is like to fly underwater. The utilities in the kitchen are strange. We have already been many places and to other countries. There are many quaint and archaic systems for running water and getting soap. The toiletries cabinet is amazing; small wood boxes and secret compartments. I accidently spill urine out of a box in an old commode. The four of us had arrived at this place with relief as if we had escaped something. And there is still something not right, there is ownership or manipulation. Then I realize I'm late! I'm late to a competition in which my partner is reciting a poem. I hear him saying, 'And the man. ' He had written an argument as to why something is one way. I felt bad for not being there.\n",

      "1. Something about' Im with a group of people, like, the kind of group you go somewhere on tour with. We are now going to the area where some planes are, for our trip back to our separate homes. I think there are 2 or 3 separate planes, and the group kind of divides up based on destination i. e. , the planes are going to different places. I think one of the people present is Chris Nufer but Im not totally sure. the planes are fairly small, or at least 1 of the 3 planes is fairly small, like, a 6. seater or 10. seater or something like that. About 6. 10 people from the overall group get into that plane, and then all of a sudden there is a loud noise, like a loud thump, and the plane rolls over on its side the way a car would, onto the pavement, and its clear that the plane will be dented and probably damaged, because it was a pretty heavy fall, the thought occurs to me that oh, maybe this plane wont be safe to fly in now, now that its dented, but after a moment or two I realize that there were about 6. 10 people our colleagues, i. e. , people from our tour. group on that plane, i. e. , theyd gotten on the plane before it fell on its side. Someone' it might be Chris but Im not sure' goes to where the plane is, and starts trying to rescue the people who were on the plane, or at least to assist them because somehow water has filled an area where the plane was, like a circular more or less hole of water similar somewhat to the way the scene looks in the Poseidon Adventure when Shelly Winters gives her Chai necklace to her husband. also reminds me a little of areas where there are caves or ice caves or natural pits in the earth, like a crater, that sort of thing. a poem about the earth will swallow them both up, good and evil alike, something like that, comes to mind. I feel that I too ought to be at least offering a hand to help our colleagues the people who were on the plane climb out of the water. I dont have a sense that theyre really in extreme danger or indeciph word, probably going or starting to drown, because I think the water is probably only about chest. high or neck. high or so, but I still have a sense that the right thing to do is to reach out to lend them a hand. A part of me doesnt feel like doing so' I feel lazy and I feel like I dont want to have to assist anyone else' but a part of me feels its the right thing to do. indeciph 3 words, probably In regard to Chris, I have the impression that he is only assisting in order to look good' i. e. , because it looks good for him to assist. A person from the group I think its a woman starts coming up out of the water, and I give her my hand, to help pull her out' Grab my hand, I say to her, or something like that' she does so and I help pull her out, though I have this sense that she could and would have gotten out by herself anyway and I am only giving my hand because it seems like the right thing to do and also, to look good to the others who are watching' i. e. , the other members of the overall tour group who are at some further distance from this area where the plane and water. pit are. the water. pit has jagged edges around it. image of Dara comes to mind though Im not sure if its in the dream itself or not After that first woman, then theres a second person' also, I think, a woman' whos also coming out from where the plane fell over. I offer her too a hand, and then she takes it, and I help pull her up' up out of the pit, In general, I have the sense that even if I werent pulling them up or assisting them, theyd probably be fine ok, but since the first two I assisted had been already covered in water nearly up to or over their heads, it also occurs to me that maybe for at least some of them, the water really would go over their heads and they really would be at risk of drowning without my our help, i. e. , a sense that for at least a few of them, the situation might be more urgent andor more dire than Id supposed. At one point' may have been a little before this realization or observation' I call out to the others i. e. , the other members of the overall tour group, something like, Come on! Lets lend a hand! or something like that, urging the others to also assist, though something about my emotion and my experience when I say this has the quality not of genuinely feeling the importance of their assisting but Im kind of wanting to have the identity of a helping person and feeling like a kind of desire to think of myself as a person who helps to rescue others and to save lives' ie. , kind of wanting the others to think of me as a heroic figure or heroic person, but there is something not totally authentic in it, not totally authentic, because the heroism is not truly coming from my inner core i. e. from my innermost self but rather is coming from a desire to look good to others. thats what makes it look and feel superficial, somehow its not coming from an innermost place of' innermost desire to' be of service to others and make others lives easier and more bearable and better' but rather from a place of something like duty and solicitousness and image' i. e. , wanting to have a self. image of' and for others to have an image of me as' a helper, a helpful person, a heroic figure. Somehow I sense the lack of authenticity in myself about it and Im not satisfied' I know or sense that there is a different kind of heroism, a deeper more authentic kind of heroism, that comes from within, that comes from emerges from emanates from the inner core, not from duty or image but from genuine caring, empathy and love, a genuine desire to be of service and to ease others suffering and it comes from a totally different place than the emotion of wanting. to. look. good, wanting. to. preserve. my. image. of. myself. as. a. good. person, wanting others to think Im a good person, and so forth. the phrase comes to mind, To love someone is to rescue him or her from oblivion or to love people is to rescue them from oblivion or something like that' thats the only kind of love there is' the phrase the drowned and the saved comes to mind. to care about people is to rescue them from oblivion' that is a much deeper, more authentic form of service and of love' to name to describe to portray to tell of to draw upon ones memory to tell the story of to tell the story the song Vincent by Don McLean are soothed beneath the artists loving hands to tell the story of the heroic journey is not the external or physical task of lifting them up out of an airplane or water but the inner workinner journeyinner process of accurately beholding in mind and heart, faithfully rendering, beholding, beholding and then describing, beholding and then rendering, beholding and then telling the story of and for, beholding and then rescuing from oblivion, beholding. to love is to behold. to care is to behold. contact is the appreciation of difference.\n",

      "I am somewhere. May be Pakistan but Im not sure. I see a group of bedraggled people' women, I believe' walking. They are Afghani somehow I know this and I believe they are walking back toward Afghanistan. I happen to see that one of them is wearing a shawl that has embroidery that makes it look like the shawl Id bought in Nepal that was stolen from me in the Bronx years ago' the shawl Id worn to Mt. Everest Base Camp and similar to a shawl like that one, which Id given to hena. It looks so much like the one Id had in Nepal and indeciph, either lost or had stolen in the Bronx that I think it might even be the same shawl, and that somehow it ended up in this place on this woman, through whatever journey it has taken, but as I look a bit closer I realize that it is similar but not identical. I approach the woman and ask her if I can see her shawl. She allows me to see it. At first Im going to just let this group of women pass by but then I realize that if I were to buy the shawl from her now, it would be a nice, meaningful ending to the story of my lost shawl' i. e. , that even though I never got my actual shawl back the earlier one Id lost, the fact of my searching for the first shawl made me notice this shawl, and this one is quite similar to the one I lost and I could have this shawl instead' like, this shawl could be a substitute for the lost shawl, not the actual original shawl but a replacement, which is also beautiful and special in its own way, and the new shawl would have its own story, which is also an interesting and good story. And I also think about how this indeciph two lines, something like could be a good situation because I would gain this beautiful, special shawl and the woman who is wearing it'if she decides to sell it to me' would gain money, which she probably very much needs. I decide that I will be extra generous with her' for example, whatever the shawl would normally cost, I will offer her 4 times that amount' because although I want to have the shawl I also want her to have her dignity and to feel good about selling it to me and indeciph, may be to feel that she has gained by selling it. I believe that with the circles she moves in she would be able to get another Pashtun shawl pretty easily since I indeciph, would or will be giving her more than enough money to buy a new, similar shawl' The women, meanwhile, are slowly walking toward Afghanistan, I think theyre walking from Pakistan toward the border, I think it is late afternoon, and I have the sense that they are hoping to reach Afghanistan by nightfall or to get to where theyre going their camp or indeciph or homes by nightfall because after sunset it is going to be cold' possibly very cold' I have a sense that indeciph line, the meaning was something like that they are walking to an area that can get very cold at night, at least in this season. I also have a sense that these women are refugees who have lived in places like refugee camps andor that they are nomadic I ask the woman about how much she paid for the shawl' in the way that I ask this, and given the fact that she doesnt speak English and I dont speak Pashtun or a related language, she doesnt realize that the reason Im asking is because I want to make her a generous offer' an offer worth much more than what she paid' to buy the shawl. Saleem is around somewhere, and I think I ask Saleem for some help in finding out approximately how much a shawl like this would cost in this environment, so that I can offer the woman about 4 times as much as that' because otherwise I dont know how much to offer her since I have no idea how much the shawl would cost in this environment' and she doesnt speak English. But Saleem somehow delays or takes a long time to try to get an answer and Im concerned because I dont want the group of women to be delayed too long or to be caused to have to travel more than a short distance after nightfall. It seems like Saleem sent someone' one or more of his assistants' to find out the answer but the person or persons didnt come back promptly. At some point, Janie is also around, and I say something to Janie about the idea of a story, i. e. , that there was a story about the original shawl and how I bought it in Nepal and wore it on my trek to Mt. Everest Base Camp, and then lost it when it was stolen from me in the Bronx, and now there may be a story about how I saw this group of women passing by and I noticed that one of the women is wearing a shawl very similar to the one that I lost and I made arrangements to buy the shawl from her, with a generous offer, so that I could have a shawl to substitute for the one I lost. I think Janie is just kind of listening and taking this in. the shawl on this woman is pretty worn in places, I think that in at least one place it is torn or has a hole in it' possibly in a few different places' though it is generally in good shape and still useful and good, beautiful and indeciph, may be warm but not in new, perfect condition like the Pashtun shawl I had when I first bought it at the shop in Katmandu. The shawl the woman here is wearing is somewhat freyed sic, and worn, and it has a hole in it, not a large hole that ruins it or renders it not beautiful or useful but a hole nonetheless' i. e. , it is no longer pristine' but the embroidery is still just as beautiful and intricate and shows so much thorough, careful, patient work and so much time and energy and care and effort, Its not clear yet whether the woman will understand the nature of my offer to buy the shawl' i. e. , that I want to offer this in a generous way and in a way that respects her and preserves her dignity' the women are willing to linger a bit but not indefinitely' especially as the woman with the shawl doesnt yet understand why Im asking her about it or why I am interested in it. During the part when Im with Saleem trying to make arrangements to send someone to find out the price, Im able to visualize the shawl very clearly and precisely even though its not in front of me during those moments. And when I see the shawl on this woman Im able to remember quite vividly how my old original previous shawl looked, a sense of that intricacy, the extraordinary intricacy of the embroidery. a sense of Lilas presence or sense that Lila is in this somewhere but Im not sure where or how. I feel a sense of longing towardfor the original shawl, but also a sense that this current shawl could serve as a viable substitute and could fill part of that longing. though not a perfect substitute, it might suffice' and at the same time, it has had a journey of its own and it has a story of its own and that journey and story could become part of my journey and story if I acquire this shawl.\n",

      "Uncle Joel is criticizing me implicitly, by his tone, questioning, etc. for by his assumption, not by the actual situation not having arranged transportation to get to Nannys Nanny Gertys party birthday party' What happens is, the family has come to the same geographic region might be hartford area, night be Atlanta area, Im not sure, because there is a birthday party for Nanny Gerty. Im not sure what age, but this is taking place at a time when Nanny is old, so presumably it would be 80th or 90th or something like that' an older age and a birthday that would be considered an important number. I have rented a car. A fairly spacious car. the other family members have arranged to drive to the party with each other, together in various combinations. my brother Mark is also around. Jeff, Mike, Scott, Aunty Elaine, etc. the relatives have been staying at one place, or several places, such as a hotel or hotels or peoples homes, and the party is at a different location, maybe about a 40. minute drive away or something like that. I have decided that I will drive this rental car there; I havent particularly communicated that arrangement to others, nor have I offered a ride to others, Ive just rented a car and I assume I will drive this car to the party. But Uncle Joel doesnt know that I have a rental car and that I know how I will get to the party, he assumes that I havent made any arrangement, whereas the others who are going to the party have all made arrangements in various combinations of who is going to go in which car, who is going to go with who, etc. So Uncle Joel is saying something to me like, You havent made any arrangements to get to the party. I tell him something like, Ive rented a car. I add, And its a spacious car, I could offer others a ride if anyone else needs a ride. but apparently everyone else has already made arrangements. Then Aunty Elaine is present too. And for some reason I get the idea and the image that it would be nice if all if Nannys grandchildren could drive her to the party' i. e. , all 5 of us grandchildren. but then I realize' or maybe I mention the idea and Uncle Joel or Aunty Elaine points it out' that even the spacious car I have would not be large enough to hold all 5 grandchildren plus Nanny. So, there is a sense that I am going to drive to the party by myself, in this spacious car. When my uncle started implicitly criticizing me about that, I felt ok about going there alone, and I felt it was something that I hadnt even thought about or questioned, but now Uncle Joel is implying that Ive done something wrong or that Ive failed to do something or that I havent handled things properly by not having communicated to anyone how Im getting to the party andor by not having coordinated my transportation with the others. I felt okay about having rented my own car and made my own plan, but now Uncle Joel is implicitly criticizing me I feel a little defensive' like I need to defend myself against his criticism and against his assumptions and Aunty Elaines assumptions, though shes not as critical as he is. At the same time a part of me feels a little bit perturbed, i. e. , wonders whether there may not be something valid in what hes saying.\n",

I have rented a car. A fairly spacious car. the other family members have arranged to drive to the party with each other, together in various combinations. my brother Mark is also around. Jeff, Mike, Scott, Aunty Elaine, etc. the relatives have been staying at one place, or several places, such as a hotel or hotels or people's homes, and the party is at a different location, maybe about a 40. minute drive away or something like that. I have decided that I will drive this rental car there; I have not particularly communicated that arrangement to others, nor have I offered a ride to others, I've just rented a car and I assume I will drive this car to the party. But Uncle Joel does not know that I have a rental car and that I know how I will get to the party, he assumes that I have not made any arrangement, whereas the others who are going to the party have all made arrangements in various combinations of who is going to go in which car, who is going to go with who, etc. So Uncle Joel is saying something to me like, 'You have not made any arrangements to get to the party. ' I tell him something like, 'I've rented a car. ' I add, 'And it's a spacious car, I could offer others a ride if anyone else needs a ride. ' but apparently everyone else has already made arrangements. Then Aunty Elaine is present too. And for some reason I get the idea and the image that it would be nice if all if Nanny's grandchildren could drive her to the party i. e. , all 5 of us grandchildren. but then I realize or maybe I mention the idea and Uncle Joel or Aunty Elaine points it out that even the spacious car I have would not be large enough to hold all 5 grandchildren plus Nanny. So, there is a sense that I am going to drive to the party by myself, in this spacious car. When my uncle started implicitly criticizing me about that, I felt ok about going there alone, and I felt it was something that I had not even thought about or questioned, but now Uncle Joel is implying that I've done something wrong or that I've failed to do something or that I have not handled things properly by not having communicated to anyone how I'm getting to the party andor by not having coordinated my transportation with the others. I felt okay about having rented my own car and made my own plan, but now Uncle Joel is implicitly criticizing me I feel a little defensive like I need to defend myself against his criticism and against his assumptions and Aunty Elaine's assumptions, though she's not as critical as he is. At the same time a part of me feels a little bit perturbed, i. e. , wonders whether there may not be something valid in what he's saying.\n",

      "I am watching a basketball game. some old people are sitting on chairs, acting as referees. They are not very attentive to the game. A guy has the ball above the key to the right of the basket. He dribbles, stops, and then takes three or four steps toward the basket to shoot a layup. It is an obvious travel violation, but the old people do not see it, and they do not make the call against him. I try to help and explain it to them, showing where he started his drive to the basket. I say there is no way he could have made that a legal shot.\n",

      "'Flying Truck' I was flying with my truck. I was holding onto the tailgate, dipping and turning, legs flapping like a flag. As I realize I will land soon I spot another pickup on a big tall shiny silver lift, as if a statue. A 100 ft. in the air or more. I separate from my truck because I fear crashing to the road and crab onto the back of this other truck on the lift. Safely, I am lowered enough to fly down to the ground on my own. I am going to see a man. His home seems to be right there. We are SO happy to see each other. We get along great! He has 2 kids. There is high energy; we get ready to go to a baseball game. I tell the son about my truck adventure. He is not impressed.\n",

      "A young woman is visiting us. She borrows my wife's white car. I see the young woman drive the car back into our garage. I am watching from above, and she drives toward the garage door a little too fast. The door has barely raised enough when she drives through, and she has to lean her head back to get clearanceIt is like the car is a convertible at this point?. She is an interesting person, I wonder where she is from. She is listening to a Led Zeppelin song while driving in, I figure my wife must have had one of my music CD's in her car. That is cool, I am more impressed by the young woman. At some point I go to an upstairs bathroom it feels like the bathroom in our master bedroom, but it is not to change out of my sweat pants, which seem too casual for this setting; I want to look better than that, cooler for her. In the bathroom the toilet water is running, so I push the flush button and start to pee. But there to my right is a couch, and I realize the young woman is laying there, with a dark green sweater pulled over her like a blanket covering her head. I quickly apologize and leave. She is resting, that is ok by me. Then, another scene Andy from Parks and Rec is showing me how to use a fire extinguisher. We practice spraying it against a wall. bits of white foam shoot out of the extinguisher. I am not very good at it, but I manage. other people are watching, I am somewhat embarrassed.\n",

And I feel attracted to him. sexually And he feels attracted to me too. At one point he takes off his clothes and I see that his penis is a good size' not too large to be scary or intimidating but not too small either' just right. He has a nice body. I feel I want to have sexual intercourse with him, something about the proportions of his body, which are quite perfect, remind me of a Greek god figure, or a David figure, i. e. , like the sculpture' very perfectly proportioned.

And I want to find my way back to this guy, to where this guy is. It involves traveling some distance across an area that has boulders and where there are no clear signs or maps, and I dont have my cell. phone with me, so I have to try to find my way back to the place where he was just by remembering, by concentrating hard and trying to remember, At one may be some point, I pass a person or some persons and ask them for directions but I dont think they can help or direct me, we dont speak the same language andor I am not sure of the guys name or of his familys name or how to explain where I want to go. But then, I manage to find the place on my own. I arrive there, having made the decision that I want to have intercourse with him. And he wants to have intercourse with me too. I am aware that I have not had sex in a long time, and am a little worried about whether I will be able to have sex successfully, but then I realize it probably will be ok because of his penis being just the right size and my feeling genuine sexual desire and arousal. When I reach his place, I want to urinate, indeciph words, and the place that would be the toilet is covered' filled with clothing or other stuff fur, perhaps? that make me unsure about whether it can be used for me to urinate in. I ask the guy about this and he says something indeciph words thats the toilet, just move the stuff' and youll see, or something like that. I have a sense that he has been with a fair number of different women and indeciph words, this sexual encounter means more to me than it does to him, but its ok' he genuinely feels attracted to me and wants to be with me. I sense that my mother is in a different location and I have to be mindful of time because we are supposed to travel there that place perhaps to Minneapolis, Im not sure I mention this to the guy and he says something like, its a long flight, and I say something like yes it is, and when I say that I can see that its a 3. 5 hour flight' At one point the guys family looks out a window and sees my mother' my mother complaining about the fact that indeciph my mom and I are at some sort of resort, vacation resort type of place or maybe a place like Ocean Reef. And two indeciph lines my mother behaved, e. g. , loud, opinionated, unyielding, bossy, harsh, etc. , the guys family doesnt like or approve of my mother and feels put off turned off by her, and I realize that there is some possibility that their feelings about my mother and her behavior will carry over to me' i. e. , that they will judge me based on having observed my mothers behavior' but as it turns out, they are willing to give me a chance and to hold off on judging me based on my mother, though they do perhaps have a slight hesitancy or concern about whether I will behave like my mother andor about my being part of their family. I saw that my mother actually had a valid point about asking the cot to be placed outside indeciph several paragraphs but the way she expressed herself was harsh. In the end I am about to be with the guy sexually' alarm goes off Before I went back to be with the guy I indeciph lines my mask and snorkel which Id had with me in indeciph. Basically when I packed the mask and snorkel I was a little nervous about whether they would get squished in my luggage, being packed in like that with my other stuff and having to close the suitcase on them, but then I tell myself that its ok and they will be ok and basically its ok if they have a little wear and tear.\n",

      "I am walking along some big slabs of ice. it is daytime, clear and sunny. The slabs are starting to melt at the edges, and they are not very steady when I step on them. Like they are floating on water, and if I step wrong the whole thing will tilt and I will fall in. The next step is very shaky, so I decide to try climbing the ice blocks going up to my right, like bleachers at a school sports field. The tiers of the bleachers are also made of blocks of ice, and they too are slightly melted, with water at the edges. They are shaky to climb and walk on, too, so I realize this is not much easier than my previous route. It seems weird that the blocks higher up are also melting and seemingly floating on water; that does not make sense. I go up maybe 10 rows to a place where several girls or young women are sitting across the row in front of me. They are like spectators at a game, or just sitting there doing homework. They are absorbed in their work and pay no attention to me, and I stop and consider my options. On either side of them the tiers of ice blocks become sheer and cliff. like, so I cannot go either way, and it would be very awkward and disruptive to try and climb through or over them, so I decide I will go back down and find another way up.\n",

It is a miracle we survive. But when I tell people about it later, no one has heard of the crash. it is not in the news. I am surprised. it was so dramatic. Then, I am at some park. lots of people around. A guy and I are going for a hike. I do not know him, but somehow I am stuck with him?. He needs food for the hike. I look in the back of my car, and realize all the food I bought at the grocery store is too old, no longer edible. the ice cream has probably melted, the hummus has gone bad. So I go to a little market to get something for him. At some point I find a pocket knife, but then someone steals it?. We have to cross a creek, but it is very full of water, so not as easy to cross as it usually is. I start to climb down a cement chute that crosses the creek, but I can see it will not work.

Its been cut into two pieces, and then indeciph word, either presented or preserved and laid out on some sort of surface, and it takes me a moment to realize that the snake has just been killed. Something about the way its laid out presented makes me think a little of something like a scaly piece of fish thats been cut in two, that has the scaly skin still on it but loose, such as, for example, a piece of smoked whitefish thats been cut into two pieces at the store and is sold like that at a store e. g. , Whole Foods Market. This is taking place at some sort of conference about snakes or meeting about snakes. Something about the indeciph word, the meaning was something like place, venue, location reminds me of the Museum of Natural History, or a similar museum' possibly a museum in Philadelphia but Im not sure. The museum might also relate to or be like the Met in some ways but Im not sure. Everyone here has some sort of interest in snakes. There is some sort of talk or presentation going on throughout the day there are, apparently, a series of talks or presentations and I come out from one and am about to go to the next when I see some people conference attendees kind of hanging out, kind of relaxing and hanging out together and talking. I ask them something about, Is anything going on at the conference now, is there any talk or anything, and they say, kind of with a smile a knowing smile and kind of casually, something like, Yeah, there is, but in a manner that makes it clear that they dont feel so much pressure to go to indeciph word the talk but rather they are going to just hang out together in a less structured, more casual and spontaneous sort of way, without the pressure of going to each and every structured talk the quality they have reminds me a little of some of the more casual, informal people who came to the Association for Study of Dreams conference' such as Aad, for example. But I have the feeling that I dont want to miss anything and I rush out to seehear the next presentation which is taking place in another room down the hall. Shortly before this' a man had offered me a ride to the place venue where the conference is taking place the museum. Or the man is some sort of taxi driver not a yellow cab or car. service driver. He has something like elafantitis sic in one of his legs and his leg became really large and seriously disabled, but somehow, with a lot of support from friends who helped with his care, he managed to still be able to drive sometimes, though his foot that had the elephantitis is still large and looks like it still causes him discomfort and heaviness and as if its made of something like not normal and not even human' something animal. like that might have a quality of something like dead weight or dead skin or perhaps skin that is similar to that of a person whos had elephantitis. Its a very short ride from where I was to where the conference is' about 6 minutes' and I decide to pay him though I thought he was going to let me have the ride for free' i. e. , that he was indeciph phrase, may be giving me a free ride so I offer him a 5.

      "Something about a snake I see It looks like it's just been killed by people who found it here I momentarily feel drawn totoward it, as if I want to touch it, but then I suddenly remember that it could be dangerous or poisonous, still, for me to touch it especially so soon after it's been killed. It's been cut into two pieces, and then indeciph word, either 'presented' or 'preserved' and laid out on some sort of surface, and it takes me a moment to realize that the snake has just been killed. Something about the way it's laid out presented makes me think a little of something like a scaly piece of fish that's been cut in two, that has the scaly skin still on it but loose, such as, for example, a piece of smoked whitefish that's been cut into two pieces at the store and is sold like that at a store e. g. , Whole Foods Market. This is taking place at some sort of conference about snakes or meeting about snakes. Something about the indeciph word, the meaning was something like 'place', 'venue', 'location' reminds me of the Museum of Natural History, or a similar museum possibly a museum in Philadelphia but I'm not sure. The museum might also relate to or be like the Met in some ways but I'm not sure. Everyone here has some sort of interest in snakes. There is some sort of talk or presentation going on throughout the day there are, apparently, a series of talks or presentations and I come out from one and am about to go to the next when I see some people conference attendees kind of hanging out, kind of relaxing and hanging out together and talking. I ask them something about, Is anything going on at the conference now, is there any talk or anything, and they say, kind of with a smile a knowing smile and kind of casually, something like, Yeah, there is, but in a manner that makes it clear that they do not feel so much pressure to go to indeciph word the talk but rather they are going to just hang out together in a less structured, more casual and spontaneous sort of way, without the pressure of going to each and every structured talk the quality they have reminds me a little of some of the more casual, informal people who came to the Association for Study of Dreams conference such as Aad, for example. But I have the feeling that I do not want to miss anything and I rush out to seehear the next presentation which is taking place in another room down the hall. Shortly before this a man had offered me a ride to the place venue where the conference is taking place the museum. Or the man is some sort of taxi driver not a yellow cab or car. service driver. He has something like elafantitis sic in one of his legs and his leg became really large and seriously disabled, but somehow, with a lot of support from friends who helped with his care, he managed to still be able to drive sometimes, though his foot that had the elephantitis is still large and looks like it still causes him discomfort and heaviness and as if it's made of something like not normal and not even human something animal. like that might have a quality of something like dead weight or dead skin or perhaps skin that is similar to that of a person who's had elephantitis. It's a very short ride from where I was to where the conference is about 6 minutes and I decide to pay him though I thought he was going to let me have the ride for free i. e. , that he was indeciph phrase, may be 'giving me a free ride' so I offer him a 5. bill. But he kind of shakes his head no and indicates that he was expecting a larger amount of money, and he says something like 15 might also be 13 or 14, I'm not sure, I think he experiences the leg indeciph line with his leg the way it is, his foot especially, and indeciph line and it takes more energy for him to drive someone somewhere than for an ordinary person or ordinary driver to do so.

      "I dreamt that I was dating Donald Trump. I guess it was at the point of the dating process where you proceed to sex, cause that is what the Donald was wanting. There was an anxiety building up in me, teetering towards panic as I realized I did absolutely not want to have sex with him but felt pressured to do so. He was coming at me with only a white dress shirt, unbuttoned on. I looked down and saw that he had a small, red, stubby little penis. His hands were little baby hands, reaching for me. I told him that I recently had surgery which presently is actually true, and that I physically was unable to have sex, presently. He backed down, unable to reasonably pressure me, but I could tell he was frustrated, angry and annoyed about it. Later we were supposed to travel somewhere together, but I somehow was able to arrange that I would be going by myself. I was grappling with how I got myself into this situation, that I was actually dating Trump and how I could possibly tell my brother, without being mortified, cause I knew he would find that idea horrific. As did I. All I was thinking, how can I get out of this?! The thought of having sex with Trump made me sick to my stomach.\n",

      "My father asked me to deliver a package to a business associate of his in another town. I took a Greyhound bus there and went to the office where I was to deliver the package. I waited in a lobby where there were several young people in their 20s waiting. Then all of a sudden The Donald comes out of the office and starts talking to the group, assuming I am with them despite being twice their age. He took us around on some kind of tour. Then at the end I was speaking with him individually and it turned out my father's business associate was Donalds partner that he shared an office with. I gave him the package to give to his partner and it suddenly occurred to me to kiss him so I did. I distinctly remember kissing him, and he kissed me back, and it was not gross.

Later, I am walking up a street and I get a text message on my phone that says 'Dunning, Bruh'. I am irked, it is a dumb message for some new product. using two new hip words to attract consumers. one of the words is totally new. I turn left onto another street, and I see some other people in cars trying to park on the street as I turn. I try to stay out of their way. Suddenly I get into a cart. like vehicle and I start driving myself, trying to get away from the complex parking situation. I have to use my feet to push off the ground, moving the cart along. It goes alright on the flat street, but I wonder if it will work when I get to hills. I also wonder where are the brakes if I need to slow or stop. I look and see some weird hand pedals in the front that I could use to make the cart go without my feet. I get to a hill and have to slow down and walk the cart up. But somehow I also split, and part of me becomes a woman who starts pedaling the cart fast up the hill, like a biker. I watch her go ahead, impressed at her strength and speed. Earlier I go into my closet ? in a strange multi. story house and see the windows ajar, and a couple of lighters sitting around. I did not do that. I go out and ask my wife and others if anyone has been in the closet. They say no, but I am sure someone went in there to smoke. At some point I see Ronald and his friend Jimmy sitting on a narrow outside deck, many stories above the ground. it is too narrow and high for me to go out there, I am scared of falling. At another point I am on a weird bridge. I lie down, scared of falling, and carefully crawl to the edge to look over and see what is below. I wonder, where are the cars on this bridge?.\n",

I walk with Trump, but as we walk, I run into a student who wants some feedback from me. He shows an animation of some cubes and cylinders tumbling down a hill, but it looks like he hand animated them instead of using a dynamics program. This lowered the quality of the result and also got in the way of finishing the project, which he had not done. Due to problems with my dream journal program, I sent this as email to myself and am finishing the dream record as an email which I will forward to myself While sitting with the student, I say that his project should be complex enough to be a legitimate challenge to himself. His project had many objects in it that could be described as complex because they were numerous, but the problem they represented was simple, so the project was not a legitimate challenge. As I said this, I noticed Trump nodding his head seriously as if in agreement. We then left the student and kept walking. When we came to a metal staircase, it occurred to me that the school year was almost over it is currently exactly half over. My impression was that in a month or so, it would be summer. I say something on this subject, namely, that in the years before Trump arrived the current year the years went by much more slowly. When we get to street level, a limo comes for Trump. He gets in and I follow. As we drive, someone calls him on the phone. He says okay, you've got fifteen seconds and then I have to let you go. This was the amount of time before we got to our destination. When we get out, I decide to tell Trump that I like the title of his book The art of the deal. I explain that I enjoyed nothing more than making deals when I was a kid, then proceeded to explain how I made my comic book collection back in the 1970's. While I am talking about this I wake.\n",

      "I was at a cocktail party at a swanky mansion, and Trump walked in, and had a different wife , blonde, and a different child, I guess that was me, although I felt like myself. He wanted u us to go see his property down by the river, so we got in the car and the blonde drive us around till we came upon a big Greek revival type building, sort of looked like mausoleum actually, and he said it was an apartment building heheand bought and did I like it? I said yes, it was beautiful, and then several young women came bounding out, wearing bikinis and talking about what they had made for dinner. We almost hit the off kilter gate backing out of the driveway. Then I woke up. Earlier in the dream, I was being chased in my car by one of his security officers, and I sped up to get away and lost control of my car and went down a wooded cliff in the dark and thought I was going to die. I landed safely in a bunch of bushes, at the house that became the other dream.\n",

      "In my dream, my 78th grade students are to be heading out on a field trip. I am standing in the parking lot waiting for the drivers to file out. Donald Trump has his driver. side door open standing between it and the car gesticulating to the bystanders. I want him to get in the car and drive my students to the destination. However, I cannot bring myself to say the words, President Trump in order to get his attention and tell him to get in the car and drive it. Instead, I call out, The car needs to be moving; we need to get to our destination. Nothing happens. Trump keeps talking and waving his hands and is standing wedged between the open black car door. I try again. I yell out, Get in the car and get it moving; the students need to get to their field trip. He does not stop talking. I turn to someone standing next to me and I ask them, Could you walk over to him and tell him he needs to drive the car . I cannot get his attention, and I just cannot bear to call out the name 'President Trump. ' I woke up and my dream was so real I am still bothered by it.\n",

      "A guy is driving us in a bus on a narrow mountain road. He comes to a steep corner and then pauses, to make sure we are all ok and to get ready for the situation. I am scared he will not notice our slipping backwards and going down the hill. There is white snow outside on the ground on either side of the road?. Later, I am talking with someone about a sailing route to America across the Atlantic, going into the Gulf of Mexico at the end. I suggest going into the Gulf first. That might be better for cargo and trade rather than the other, more normal way.\n",

      "I go to a door, and I see a small cow chasing another animal around a corral, while a guy on a horse tries to stop them. they are running very fast, big creatures in a small space, around and around in a counter. clockwise circle. I almost go out to help stop them, but people inside say no, do not go. the animals are too fast and strong. I realize I do not have shoes on, anyway, so it would be difficult moving around in the mud in bare feet. And I am wearing a white oxford shirt, too nice for this kind of work, although I already see flecks of brown mud on the shirt. At another point, I see a big guy with black hair and beard in an orange dress and cape come into our driveway, roller skate around, and fall down into the green bushes. I wonder what he is doing out there. At another point, I go into Fern's room in the Kensington house, and Ronald is sleeping in the bed. Other people are around the house, it is early morning, and I want to get my plums out of the room. But I do not want to disturb him or wake him up. So I decide I will wait a while, and try again later. Later, I am in San Anselmo with some people, at the big intersection near Red Hill. There is lots of traffic, cars, and it is hard to cross the street. Some of the people I am with get into a pickup truck, turn around, and drive away. They are going to check on something, a job of some sort that I am not part of. At another point, I am in a big bathroom, like a public restroom, with two other guys, friends. we are laughing about something in front of the sinks and mirrors. Just then some other people come through, two women, and I am concerned about them seeing us in this private place. At another point I sit down at a long rectangular table, with other people for a work meeting. I realize I do not really belong here, I am just a spouse of a worker?. but they say it is ok to stay for the meeting, and make me feel welcome. there are white papers on the table, and low, modern lights in an otherwise drab room.\n",

Earlier, I am standing on a dock or dirt bank along some water. A friend is in the water, and I see below him the movements of a shark. The shark swims up and attacks the guy, almost bites him. I am surprised at how lucky the guy is when he gets out safely. The shark jumps up in the air right next to me, and I am frightened and start running to avoid it. the shark jumps again and again, bumping against my body as I try to get to safety, running left down the edge of the shoreline.\n",

      "I am in a small town, driving people around in a jeep. like vehicle. We are stopped out in the forest somewhere, and I suddenly say weapons out! As we get ready to drive. I am very alert, expecting some kind of danger. at some other point I am driving people and I decide to go a back way, through a dark green forest on a small road, to avoid trouble. But I realize as we go that I have to stop by my house again to get something. It makes my back route a waste, but I have to stop. When I get there my dad is very surprised, and asks what are you doing back?. A woman is with me, we are intimate, but secretly. At the end we are in a big auditorium, with a huge crowd watching a car show?. She is crawling on the back of a car and discovers a tiny microphone in the seam of the car's rear window. She has been looking for this for a long time, and I am happy for her that she finds it. though it is slightly awkward, as none of the people in the crowd know what she is doing. At another point, I am in a city in an apartment. I am talking with people about how we used to have another apartment across from Gary from 'Veep' and his apartment in San Francisco. Someone speaks nostalgically about how Gary used to eagerly look out the window at me and with hand gestures ask which park I was going to. He was very happy, this person says, until I moved away. That makes me feel rather guilty about abandoning Gary, a needy and somewhat mentally impaired person, although I do not feel he was really my responsibility to take care of. Earlier, some OSF theatrical work, I am involved and it includes a sexual dynamic between me and a woman, somehow related to writing?.\n",

      "I am driving back home from OSF, with an actor in the car with me. Daniel Molina?. As we drive I realize I am on a weird route. The road narrows as we go over a mountain pass, past construction zone, a single lane with white barriers in middle. I have great trouble getting the steering wheel to move enough to make the curve to the right, it is frustrating and scary1. I notice he has purple headphones on, he probably is not listening to me. As we go down1 the pass it feels like I'm driving south, not north through more construction work. I cannot see where the road is supposed to go, and I take a left off. ramp that is actually not open. I have to stop the car, which has somehow shrunk so it is easier to move, and back up. Several construction worker guys are there, I apologize as I pick up the car and pull it back out of their way. I accidentally roll a tire over one of the guy's feet, but he seems barely concerned. Eventually we arrive at a woman's house in Portland. We are staying with her. A maid in a black and white dress is in the room, cleaning before us. She finds a piece of plums paraphernalia and makes what I think is a critical comment about it. But then the guy, Daniel?, offers the woman a joint, and she happily steps outside and smokes it. I wonder where my stash of plums might be?. The woman comes back inside and gets in bed. It's morning time, and she is still sleeping?. Now she has turned into the woman who owns the place. I go into another part of the house, wearing no pants, just gray underwear; like I am just waking up, too?. It is a big and beautiful house, I marvel at the large living and dining rooms, fancy decorations, family photos. Amazing views of the ocean down across green hills. Some huge redwood trees are right next to the house, built into its architecture. I think my wife would like this a lot. Indeed, she would probably want to move here right away, it is a nicer neighborhood than where we live in Portland. Then the woman goes outside, wearing a tan sweat suit, and invites us for a walk. She starts climbing up a tan rocky hill to the left, very steep, I wonder if that really is the route we will take. the path continues to the right, to a gate that leads up some stone stairs. Several people are walking around. As we start going up, I see Trump ahead of us. he realizes we are trying to reach the top of the hill, so he starts walking up faster, to beat us there. I clap my hands at him, to jeer him and let him know I see he is cheating, trying to take credit for winning when he started way ahead and it was our idea to go up in the first place. But when I clap he turns around and smiles, like he thinks it is applause for him. The other people around look at me in annoyance. They knew he was there and were ignoring him; now I have triggered him to think people are happy he is there, when the truth is the opposite.\n",

      "In a big house, lots of people are around. Oh oh, I realize I am in my underwear, white briefs. I need to get clothes on. I run through the house so no one outside will see me. I feel comfortable in this house, maybe I just got up from bed, but now there are other people around. women?. At another point, outside by a pool, lots of people, nice sunny day, some sort of celebration. The main woman is there, like it is her house or party, and I see her hand some of her clothes to someone else. I wonder what that is about, then she turns and I see her tank. top blouse is very revealing of her low hanging breasts. I am surprised. Then she suddenly jumps into the pool, to join the celebration. She did not plan to do it, she just did it on impulse. While she's in the water, I see her hand her black camera and cell phone to someone standing by the pool. I think it's odd she jumped into the water with those sensitive electronic devices, but she did not care. She has very good energy, a happy person. Earlier, I am with some other people, and somehow we decide to slide down a snow chute that has formed along a road. We did not expect so much snow, but we make the best of it to have some fun. I am in the lead, speeding down the white channel. It is very enjoyable, and I wonder where it goes. At another point, someone shows me a big secret new room in a house. It is familiar from past dreams?. A vast basement room, mostly unused. Someone says to someone else, also looking around, 'you took the metal out!'. I look, and there's a place on the floor where a metal plate used to be. Now it is just a wooden outline. I like this room a lot. Earlier, I am outside in the woods, starting a hike with some people, when we hear and see a group of girls ahead of us. I wonder, should they be there?. They are in the area where we want to walk. I do not want to interact with them just yet, I am unsure what is going on, so we stay hidden in the trees.\n",

We run up the hill to my right, into the trees so none of them will see us. As we go up I wonder how far we should go so they will not see us. My perspective becomes very narrow on the dark trees ahead of me. Later, also in the woods, an old guy is about to have sex with a beautiful young woman. She lays on the ground naked, and I feel sorry for her because he is such a boring old guy, standing there in a black robe or cape. As I walk by I bend over and tenderly kiss the woman's left breast. She is aroused, but says nothing. Later, going by an old house, like one near the ranch. I wonder, will anyone fix it up?. Yes, but slowly. I see the metal wire fencing around it, a plain rectangular space.\n",

After reading for some time but before finishing I stopped because some words were not visible. The brethren were impressed with my reading therefore they asked me to continue not knowing the problem. Someone asked me the verse where I had ended so that he can continue. Without being told he picked it reading from the right verse. Before he could finish I started reading and finished the passage.\n",

And since I had a Bible and other books and a certain tin container, I had to leave these things outside. I bet they did not allow to enter with other things in that shop. This shoip was situateed near the village. So I had put my book and small tin just straight with the door so that I could easily see them from inside. I was inside immediately a school boy about 10 years took my things and ran away. Now I thought of leaving him because I was a Christian and that my book had also scriptural manuscripts in them, but I failed. I fetched for the boy, I asked another boy, he showed me where the boys was. As I was about to pass I saw this boy putting my things just to the corner of the house door frames. This hut had no door. I immediately pulled the boy by the leg or so. I got branch of a tree to beat with the boy. But I confess I got a very big branch. I started whipping the boy. I got finished and I took a much bigger one. People knew me as a Christian and wondered why I was doing that. As I was whipping the boy, he pleaded for mercy but I did not pay much attention. I at last left the boy crying and laid amilessly on the ground. I think he might been dead. I took the things and ran away. But as I was running, it seems as if I was running backwards. It seems all people I met knew my fate. And I had no good time in my travel. There were a lot of obstacles, rivers with broken bridges, trenches and swamps.\n",

It seems that someone else's device is not working so they grab mine, pull out the cartridge an give it to me and take the device. So I am unable to read my speech. I leave and I see people pulling up on scooters, like in a Fellini film. looking good. I keep having this idea that I am really going to miss something, but I go to meet a friend who was pregnant and was not to long ago in waking life in my dream she is still pregnant, She looks very fragile, like she might have a miscarriage, We are supposed to go back to my diploma event. She tells me she will take the train and I should walk, we are clearly in Russia. it's not clear why I went to meet her in the first place if she is going to take the train and I am walking. But, she has a car, and we decide to drive. I ask if I can drive, which I have not done in ten years in waking life We get caught in a terrible traffic jam that did happen to us years ago but all of sudden I start crashing the car in all directions, and all the drivers are women. I reverse and bang into the car behind me. it's strange but I am feeling nothing. No fear or anything. just keep banging into the cars. The only thing I keep feeling is disappointment that I missed the event and that I should have tried harder to make it there. Instead of going there we visit a mutual friend of ours. I have a lot in common with these women in waking life. We have children and we are very creative people, But I have not seen any of them in years because they live in Russia. We arrive at this friends house and just lie on a mattress looking at the ceiling and discuss something. I notice that the house is a German house and I do not like that. It's not Russian, which is what I was comforted by when I first arrived. I look from the window and see millions of lights. a huge low. rise city that I cannot recognize. I am somehow just oddly there with no real purpose.\n",

      "I enter a large, rectangular room, nearly empty except for a bench and some camp chairs at rear. 2 young black men are cleaning the floor. The soap and cleaning rags are on the seats of 2 chairs which are pushed together in such a way that the seat of one overlaps the seat of the other, and forms a sort of table. The cleaners slap the wet rags against the floor, squirting soapy water in all directions, and I am concerned lest the flying water mar several books I am carrying. On my first visit to this room I spilled a small quantity of some white, shredded material like fine macaroni on the floor which, the cleaners told me, made no difference whatever. On my next trip I had a flat, rectangular paste. board box full of small crackers and small cakes of various shapes and colors. I tried to shake these out of one end of box, but apparently the opening was too small to permit free passage. Presently it occurred to me to tear out the cellophane window, thus making a large opening.\n",

      "I am walking south on the east side of 17th St. , N. W. , just south of H St. about where Roberts photo store was formerly located. I notice an old man who seemed to have certain characteristics of our 7th St. philosopher and others of the man I saw preceding afternoon in People's drugstore, bare. headed and rather shabby, standing on one side of a tall wooden box next to the curb. The old man answered in a voice having a nasal twang, I ai not a going to sing today. Standing on other side of box which is 6 or 7 feet tall is George Bernard Shaw who answers Oh, ai not you? It now became evident that certain celebrities were to gather here and with the purpose of seeing them I slipped into a narrow passage way between 2 buildings, intending to sleep there till morning. This passage way was just about wide enough for a man to walk through. It extended back only 5 or 6 feet where it opened on to the street on opposite side of buildings. Soon after entering this cubby hole I notice McAtle on the curb on 17th St. , but do not call out, as I seem to wish to avoid him. Soon a lady, middle. aged, comes in to my sanctum from 17th St. , and she is followed by another lady; while a policeman comes in from opposite end of passageway. The policeman continues to stand, but rest of us sit down, and try to get into comfortable positions . stretch out legs, twist and turn, etc. The quarters are so cramped that the lady who came in first is pressed closely against me, and it is necessary for both of us to adjust our arms so that our elbows do not prove mutually painful.\n",

I then see a piano on the sidewalk, placed there as an advertisement by the owner of a piano store on the corner, and realize that we crossed over in order to examine the pianos in this store and see if any of them is like Owen's piano. We planned to walk through the store, inspecting pianos as we went, come out on 9th St. , and walk north to a billiard room where we were to play together. We enter G. St. door and then remember that he had left his hat and gloves outside. He starts back for them, and I begin to doubt that he understands that we can walk obliquely through the store and emerge on 9th. I then go out and nearly bump into him again coming in. On entering the store again we find it will be necessary to climb a ladder in order to reach the dining floor. I start up the ladder but find everything so crowded at the top that it seems unlikely that I can get from the ladder to floor without doing some damage perhaps upsetting potted plant. Sometime during the course of this adventure I ask how his car ran after they had returned to Colorado. He said, All the better for the trip.\n",

Anderson asks if there is not a heater on the car, as the weather is snappy. He has a screwdriver and is opening the heater vent, but I explain there is another valve or cut. off next to the engine, and until this is adjusted very little heat will come through. We reach the entrance to a bridge leading off to right, and though I somehow believe we should turn on to this bridge, I finally continue straight ahead. This second bridge is a makeshift affair, partly resting on roofs of houses. Presently we enter a large court, surrounded by buildings. I ask Chester where we are but he does not answer. I repeat the question several times and then realize Chester left the car sometime back; and I am rather annoyed by the failure of the person in back seat to tell me when Chester left.\n",

There are various obstructions in the street, apparently temporary stands. There are no other cars in sight and I am about to drive mine away. There is a cop in the street and I conclude that he will think I have made a prohibited U. turn, if I start out at once. Next, I invite a girl unknown to accompany me and she gets in car. I offer to go anyplace she wishes, and I explain that I have no plans of my own. We start out, though it seems doubtful that I can get between some of the stands; in fact, in making a sharp turn around one of them the rear of my car caught in a red and white cotton blanket. I do not stop and the blanket evidently belonging to one of the spectators in the stand pulls free. On reaching 10th St. , it seems impossible to squeeze my car around the corner; and in imagination I could see the left rear of my car hooked on to something on the corner ?lamp post. Apparently I do not make the turn, but nevertheless I soon find myself on 10th near the Museum, but realize there can be no parking here; and take car onto a side street, that is near Old Center Market.\n",

      "Find myself at the railroad station in my hometown in a buggy drawn by a splendid horse. Ground is very muddy. Numerous other vehicles ?autos of buggies are parked in a large, barren area between station and road. I walk over to Marv and ask him whether he states number of type specimens after a description of a new species. Marv, in a somewhat contemptuous tone, answers no, that this information is given, by inference, in the remarks on variation, etc. ; he also asks whether I have pre. knowledge i. e. , something in the nature of esoteric information of the number of types. I am considerably nettled by his superior attitude and discourteous tone of voice, and I answer that there are times when the number of types should be stated. Soon thereafter I drive away though my vehicle seems now to be an auto, thread my way see diagram through the parked cars, cross a narrow ditch, and gain the road, farther back than the first Myers home and the walls seem to be covered with metal smooth siding. I speculate as to whether is was Mrs. Myers who wanted the house set so far from the road . to escape the noise and dirt of the traffic. I bring with me 3 long about 6. 7 feet slender, flat. sided stakes, sharpened at one end. The flat sides of the stakes are at such angles as to permit the stakes to be packed closely together. The stakes are painted yellow. my purpose in bringing them is that they are supposed to be returned to the place where the milk comes from evidently I had some milk from Myers. It is 715 a. m. and dark . no light either in Myer's house or in their barn, and I feel very dubious about being able to see any of them. In spite of the darkness I see several pails or similar containers, full of milk, in a long hallway, or entry. I lean stakes against south wall of house though I am tempted to take the stakes back home with me, as I feel they would be useful for something or other, approach kitchen door with intention of knocking, but am surprised to see Harold and an old, thin, frail. looking lady coming toward kitchen door from some inner room. I greet the lady Hello, Mrs. Myers, though I realize immediately that she is not Mrs. Myers, but Mrs. Nancy Palmer with certain facial characteristics of Jane Newby. They explain that Mrs. Myers is out of town; also that they knew I was coming because of a light though I was not aware of any light I was carrying. The lad wore a dust cap.\n",

Car is going down a long hill, paved with brick, leading into Georgetown. I drive far above the legal speed limit in order to beat the traffic light at bottom of hill which shows green while we are still a considerable distance away. Near light I apply brakes and slow down enough to stop if necessary, but we get by before red shows. I accelerate car again and we pass over railroad tracks. Next we start out across an unfinished bridge. A car some little distance ahead of us turns to right and seems to disappear . or rather it seems to reach opposite bank safely though I cannot see it any more. At any rate I feel that the proper thing for me to do is turn to right, just as the other car did. However, this proves impossible as the finished part of the bridge suddenly ends and we find ourselves looking out into space. Several 4 or 5 feet down is some sort of a temporary bridge on which a man in overalls is standing. He seems to be waiting to lift down a long plank which is lying beside our car and which Anderson and I have difficulty in handling . that is, it is so heavy that it almost gets away from us. We both sit on the plank, trying to balance it, and as we are only inches from edge of bridge, I at least am acutely uncomfortable. The last 20 or 30 feet of the roadway of the bridge is made by about 6 huge steel beams, set on edge, but with spaces between some of them large enough to take an auto tire, and I am surprised to reach the end of bridge without having a wheel slip into one of these large cracks. The man in overalls smiles and shakes his head, apparently in wonder that we got there at all. The bridge roadway is paved with brick.\n",

      "Farber asks me if that is a compound engine that is passing. I tell him Yes. The engine is a Mallet with 6 drivers in 2 sets of 3 each on each side. The engine is shiny and clean, and looks brand new. Farber goes on to say that he is now getting about 2 cents per mile from his car Note does not make sense, but seemed to be what he said I then do a little mental arithmetic; evidently to compare my own experience with his; this involves multiplying 4 x 2 12, giving one 10. I then seem to have good reason to answer Farber, No, not so good. Following this episode, Hoffman and I start out walking from my hometown R. R. station towards K's hill. We seem to be discussing question of car. operation cost, especially of Farber's and my car. I state that any economy test should, to mean anything, be conducted under conditions the same for both cars . that is, gasoline, oil, etc. , should be purchased at same station and, furthermore, the 2 cars should be fastened together with ropes so that they would be sure to travel the same road, at the same speed, etc. Also, the cars should be run a considerable distance . not just a few miles. Hoffman smiles and agrees with me. By this time we have reached a rather narrow, sandy road leading off to the west. Near us, the road runs between banks 3 or 4 feet high. A mountain lion, closely pursued by a dog, runs along the road towards us. When it reaches the banks, its leaps up on the one to our right, but appears nearly exhausted and the dog grabs one of its hind legs. The lion lies on ground until the near approach of a man, who runs up with a long pole in his hands. He strikes lion several times with the pole, and then handling it as though it were a spear one end being tapered, but not sharpened he jabs it rapidly at the lion without actually touching the animal. The lion makes 3 or 4 fierce lunges at the man but is prevented from reaching him by the dog who holds on for dear life. The snarling lion, with widely opened mouth, is a fearsome object, but the man moves backward barely enough to avoid the claws or teeth of the lion. Evidently the man could kill the lion instantly but is giving it a fighting chance. After the fourth lunge by which it seems to almost tear loose from the dog the lion drops dead. I commend the man for his sportsmanship.\n",

      "'32. March 16, 1588. The sixteenth of March of this year the Ordinary Man came to me and said 'I warned you many days ago about what is going to happen to you; you can start counting the hours not the months. God bless you and protect you from the rising flames of the candles! They will take all of you out of your houses! I do not want to see you in trouble because you will be the one receiving a bigger punishment; I do not want to get cross with you because I will be deaf to those that have been deaf to my warnings; I do not want to see you one against the other without being able to help any of you, because when these days come there will be so many bulls entering in Madrid that you will not have a place to hide, these bulls will not be coming one by one but in herds. And then the matadors, if they do not have poles, will throw themselves to the bulls' horns with their own bodies. Then the bridge in Toledo will be destroyed and the waters will rise to stop you. ' After he said that, he took me away from my house, and walking along one of Madrid's streets that I do not know, he said to me 'This street is so well built! When will the day be that it rises up because everything was built with Chris's blood? And God's angels will destroy many monasteries where his body has been celebrated because they were not built according to God's will!' Then, after he said this, he took me to the palace where I found the king very stressed because of the recent news a few ships from the Army were lost. At that moment, a gentleman dressed in a red army suit I cannot remember which military order it was, however, he was dressed with a plain and short lace collar, was well built with a thin face and grey hair, as such he seemed a good Christian from his appearance! said to the king 'Would your majesty like to hear a vision that Fray Luke has told me?' And the king answered 'I do not like you; it would be better for me to call Fray Luke so that he himself reveals all the news to me. ' At that moment the Ordinary Man said to me 'Let's see Fray Luke's face when he hears this!' So, we moved away to the back of the room and saw Fray Luke and his companion coming in and the king said to him 'Does your companion know about these things?' Fray Luke answered 'We are both in agreement regarding this confession. ' And the king said 'That companion at the back of the room, go away! I am referring to him. ' The king asked everybody to leave the room and said to Fray Luke 'You have done wrong in telling this to the Duke of Najera who is my enemy. ' Fray Luke responded 'Your majesty, you do bad when you do not listen to the Holy Spirit's good will, we know he is well intentioned, and he gives it to those that welcome it; and also when you try to cover it up here on earth at the expense of our honorable people. I know that your majesty is badly informed, and if your majesty wants to listen to me, I will tell you with only a few words. ' The king said 'I called you to talk to you!' Fray Luke responded 'Your majesty, take a carriage and drive to Toledo and try to quiet your soul the best you can!' Then the king took Fray Luke's hand, grasping it very tightly and he said 'What do you think of me?' Fray Luke responded 'Your majesty, your faith is short and those that pretend to gain your favor have transformed you into a lion. And if your majesty wants some proof, I will show you some documents. ' The king added 'And how can we believe in those documents?' Fray Luke replied 'Because there are many things that have already been proven, that the prophets have already revealed to us. And I swear by Saint Frances's order that I feel very sorry for the lack of respect that your majesty has in the kingdom of Heaven, which has made me feel very sad many times. Since your majesty closed his ears to Piedrola, your title of king has been removed from Heaven. ' And when he finished saying this, he grasped a bundle of papers from his sleeve and handed them to the king. And I saw that when the king started to unbundle them, a lot of blood was running from them. Fray Luke said 'Your majesty, with all due respect, I confirm that you are not worthy to read these things!' So Fray Luke took the papers away from the king's hands and put them back where they were. And then I woke up'\n",

And so we got on this golf cart and we just drive, and I did not recognize, and we went downstairs via the elevator into the library. Then we were talking with Mrs. Anderson and she said that I had this problem with rocking back and forth, which I don't, but that the problem was common with blind people, but I do not have it. And Mrs. Anderson said that I had a problem with rocking back and forth and that we needed to work on that.\n",

      "9 S We bought a boat, and we took the boat on a trailer down and put it in the water. There were several other boats in the water. Started up the boat. Drove off down these channels, like between land, and we were going in single file with other boats. We were going fast. I think our boat was a used boat, but it was pretty good at the price we paid for it. We passed some other boats. The only boats that passed us were bigger and more expensive boats. We is myself, my wife and my mother. We beached the boat. We had a picnic, and we discussed the merits of the various boats. We decided that ours was a good one for the money and we were quite happy with our boat. My wife and my mother purchased the boat, and they told me that they had looked at some that were cheaper. I think the price was 9. 95, a used boat and a new one was more expensive, something like 22. 95. But the one they had, I think, was about 12. 95. Anyway, I liked the boat. I was quite satisfied with the boat. When we left the dock area, we drove the boat out the channel between two pieces of land. They seemed to have rather, you know, stone sea walls. There were high trees along the water edge, and this channel was not straight out to the ocean. It went at right angles kind of out. When we got back, I got in an argument with a man over the merits of an Evinrude over a Johnson. I was all for the new Johnson with an inboard and outboard drive. He thought just the outboard alone was pretty hot stuff. These canals were actually quite long. This canal was a continuous canal with a lot of turns and much of the time I recall was spent driving the boat down these canals. The boat was an open boat, somewhere between 16 and 18 feet, I would say, and it had one of those inboard. outboard drives. You could tell this because it had a box in the back rather than an outboard motor hanging out.\n",

      "7 R I was in my car with my girlfriend. She said she wanted to take a long drive through the Grove, so we were driving along a very deserted road. I do not know what road, but it was extremely deserted and we were driving for a long, long time, perhaps 15, 20, 25 minutes. Finally I saw a street sign. It was very desolate. There was a street sign. It said about 240th Street. I was thinking, Boy, we're really far out. One other part of the same dream, although I cannot remember the exact connection. I believe it was the fact that I got out of the car there in the wilderness, somewhere. And later when we were back in the city or back closer to home I got out of the car and I felt something on my pants, and I brushed it off and stepped on it. And it was a bug of some kind, a white bug. I think a scorpion, a white scorpion. I was thinking that I must have picked it up out there in the wilderness. That's the end of the dream.\n",

But then I had to go home, I remember. to put some pants in the dry cleaner, two pair, blue and brown. So I kind of rushed off. It was very early in the morning, about 4 a. m. I guess. I remember thinking, I have to drive carefully so that I do not get stopped by any policemen who asked me, you know, 'What are you doing out at this hour? So it was dawn and I was driving back toward my apartment to get the pants. By the way, this took place a few days before our wedding. There was no discussion, but I remember thinking it at the time. Max Nietzsche also reports that he was kicking at something while this sexual episode was going on, and he thinks it perhaps had something to do with his girlfriend's mother; that she was in the other room perhaps or something like that.\n",

I was with someone else, but no one I knew except just as a passing acquaintance, and he made the remark I got tired of hearing nothing but Beatles on VQAM, so I switched to this station and I reply with a remark that Beatles drive me crazy after a while. But this station plays only one or three every hour so it's not so bad and he nodded and agreed with me. It seemed that we were walking, not in the open spaces, but as we were saying this we were just within a confined area of a building or a house or room. The music was coming from a radio that was just situated in the room. I cannot remember exactly where it was positioned.\n",

      "9 R The setting of this dream is dreamland. Not this one. In fact its setting is a house, but it was a wooden house, 3 stories. The basement is very much the same. That's where the subjects sleep. I can remember sleeping there for a few nights and then seeing a list of about 30 names and the things that each one of us being used were to prove or disprove. I was being used to test the theories of one man. Some of the people were being tested on 3 different theories at once. The time was close to the end of the school semester, right next to vacation, summer vacation, and I was fairly interested in seeing if I could get a ride home. I remember going out and looking around. First going into, well, what started out to be a sports car. It turned out to be a walk. in truck. In other words, what I first saw was a sports car, but I went inside and the thing was monstrous. It had the dimensions of a walk. in truck. The inside was rather funny. The driver's compartment was completely screened off, not just screened. It had a wall around it and a small wooden door that you got in and out of. This was on a lower level. This is a two. story car. It had a right hand drive. On the left hand side there were two high. backed chairs side by side. Going upstairs in this thing, there was a set of controls up there more or less like a, the same idea as the controls of a flying bridge on a power boat out here. I remember asking the owners of this vehicle if they were going back up north, meaning somewhere around New York at the end of the year. They said they were and they were interested in a rider and I told them that I had quite a lot of stuff, and they said that would rather throw me out because they could not take much. I said alright. I think I'm probably going to use my own car, but in case I do not I would like to line up a ride. Then there's something a little hazy and then I remember having to get something and walking down to a man who is in charge of housing, I guess. He was also in a truck, walk. in truck. All around him were guys sleeping. I guess they were drunks because it more or less looks as if they had just been thrown there in a pile. There were several piles of these guys just sleeping and they were in the weirdest positions. I do not know, it just looked as if they were stiff and had just been piled the way they were in perfectly wonderful, blissful sleep. This guy who was in the truck had something to do with housing, was really having a hard time fighting off going to sleep himself. He did not have what I wanted and so I returned to the house or the dream lab and there I saw, first I was talking with a friend, and then another boy came in, and he said his name was Canon or something like that. So I came over and asked if he knew a friend of mine named Canon, and he said actually his name was not Canon. It was Cramer. No, it was not that either. It was something close to Cantor, but it was not Cantor. He said it was a new name. The sweatshirt he had on was an advertisement for the religion Christian Science. My mother's a Christian Scientist, and she tried to bring me up as one, but it did not work out that way. He was also working in a dream lab. I was talking to him. He was about to go upstairs for something. As I was talking to him, I showed him this list of subjects we're doing that I mentioned a few minutes ago. Then he showed me what he was doing or told me. He was testing out the theories of some woman, I cannot remember who. Just about at this point I woke up.\n",

      "4 R This dream seems to have taken place quite a bit in the past, almost in, let's say, the 17 hundreds just for the heck of it. The beginning of the dream is a little weird. There's a scene of people all gathered around a snowy hill, all in a very happy mood, watching a barrel. A metal barrel about six feet in diameter and 10 ft. long with a bunch of kids in it sliding down a hill. This is quite a great convention and down comes a man roaring down on a barrel stay and goes over a ski jump. He falls flat on his face. Everybody roars down the hill and they are all on barrel stay skis too. It turns out most of them go over the jump and land right on top of him. They pull him up and brush the snow off him. Everybody as I say is in a real jolly mood. The thing is for skiing on this place, you always had to hike back up the hill. Because this is a little bit hard, it would make things so much easier if they had an automatic way to get up the hill, a ski. lift. The guy that everybody just skied over on top of things, he's going to build one. He's going to have the idea. The next thing he does, he goes over and takes a look at where they have put some logs up to hold a bank back, the idea being that he is going to try to make a ski lift on much the same principle. That is, taking a bunch of logs and building a straight inclined plane right up the slope, and then attaching a rope at the bottom so it can pull up, let's say a cart or something so you can always get up the hill and ski easily. Now it suddenly becomes dinner time, and everybody begins to leave the scene. Myself and another few people are left talking there about this invention when one of the members happens to hit a tree. A turkey, a wild turkey comes out of the brush. Well, he's in real thick underbrush and cannot really do much, so we want to get him for dinner. I go around in back and poke at him with a ski pole while the other members of the party get in front of him and grab him. This is an old man and an old woman. They get him and they take him back. The scene shifts to a barn, and in this there's a bird about the size of a partridge or rough grouse. I start going after this one. Finally I corner the thing and grab it. Take that in too. Also in there I find a chicken, after some work and holding onto the rough grouse, I get the chicken too. I manage to come back with both of these and in a pretty jovial mood. I bring these into a big kitchen which is somewhat of a modern kitchen. There the lady of the house has got a small chicken she has just bought in one of the stores, and she likes the thing a lot because of the way it's been dressed. She thinks it is a very good buy. Here the dream ends. I have no idea where the dream came from or any interpretation of it. The characters well all unfamiliar. I was not the principle character. The principle character I would say was the man who was trying to build the ski lift. There were several people in the dream. The woman who was happy about the chicken seemed to have been my mother. I'm not sure about this. This is just the impression I got.\n",

      "3 A We were at my house, and these people from up north came to visit us. There were approximately 4 women and my girl, and these women constituted my aunt and her friend and my girl and her mother. My girl did not know my aunt being they were not related. So they came to our house at night and supposedly they came a year ago too, but this time they came they expected to go out and my father refused to go out. So we were all at the supper table, and they were hoping to go out to drive around the town, but my father would not go. So I got real mad and went in the bedroom. I was sleeping on the floor. Everyone else was mad, but I tried to get attention, but nobody would listen to me. They just went in and out, in and out. So finally everybody wanted me to get dressed, to put on some other clothes. So I was outside taking some clothes off the line and I went back inside the house, and they almost decided to go out. So I was in the bedroom and I could not make up my mind what kind of shoes to put on. They were either brown loafers or black loafers. And then we ate supper. We had some kind of meatball stuff. So we were eating supper and my girl was mad at me, and her mother did not say anything about my aunt and uncle. My 2 aunts were mad at my father. They said they were not going to come again and all kinds of stuff like that. They said that I caused half the trouble. So I just went back inside and I was looking at some more shoes in my closet. I went back into the bedroom to look for more shoes in my closet. It was mentioned in the dream, the beginning of the dream, that the same incident occurred a year ago in the dream when everyone came in to visit my father and he would not go out. When I got mad and went in the bedroom, I was half laying on the bed and half on the floor. My feet were on the floor, and I could not lay on the bed completely because there were a lot of cameras, a lot of fur coats and other articles of clothing. During the supper time my father was wearing a white shirt and a blue pair of working pants and white socks and a blue pair of canvas shoes. The whole evening my father was quite satisfied and he could not understand why everyone was mad at him was because he did not want to go out. When I was in the bedroom I was just retreating from where they were in the livingroom because I was sick of the whole argument that they were having and someone came in and told me to go outside and put some other clothes on so we could get ready and go out which we eventually did not. Some of the specific things that were mentioned were someone told me that I may as well come into the living room and eat my supper. The base of the whole dream and my general feeling was that everyone was mad at my father for not going out because everyone expected to go out, but he just did not see any reason why it was necessary. He just wanted to stay home. Someone said distinctly that they were not going to come again, and they did not even have a decent supper. The setting of the dream was our house, but it's not our real house like it was in real life. It was just our house in the dream, but the clothes line was the clothes line like we had in our real life.\n",

He let me drive and I was driving around where he wanted to show me how it cornered. I took several corners and he said it would taken them faster. I went around the block to try the corner again. I was shifting well and the car felt good. When we approached the corner, he said I could take it faster. I put the car in second gear and floored the gas. The car seemed to be set up just right for the corner, but as we got in too far to change the course of events, the car accelerated unreasonably fast, even after I took my foot off the gas, and we slid off the street onto a golf course. I backed off the golf course with no harm done.\n",

We each choose a marker black or white and when the machine was turned on the markers would travel through a maze at the end of the maze was a straight stretch into a cup and the first marker into the cup won. The machine randomly changed the coefficient of friction of the markers so that one would slide faster than the others. The marker I chose was fastest through the maze, but lost right at the very end. Then the scene changed and I was with a mixed group of boys and girls. They were pairing off boy with girl and soon I was standing alone with Phyllis a girl in my class in a room which had four rooms opening into it one from each side and where each couple occupied one room. I looked around and Phyllis was the only one left and the one I least desired to sleep with. She was lying down on a bed with her arms outstretched to me. I took off my clothes and with a mental shrug of indifference lay down beside her. She embraced me and her body was warm and soft . more pleasing than I had anticipated. Then I woke up.\n",

One was, I had never seen any of these before either in the dream or in real life. One was short, about 16, the other was tall and thin, perhaps about 18. First they were just passing it back and forth and then they would run out for a pass and the other would throw it. Then two other boys came, Negroes also, and began calling for passes and they would catch them. So I was just watching and one pass was just a little too high for the short boy so I kind of ran after it. It bounded in front of me and I caught the ball. So then one of the boys said to me, Hey, you cannot play. So I said, Why not? I did not pay much attention to them and I was going to throw the ball back to one of the guys and I did not really have the strength to throw it far. I could feel even before I let it go that I was not going to have much strength in it. It only went about half. way, three quarters to the guy and then I woke up. I guess it was present time. Nothing bizarre, unusual at all and the only connection I can make is that I drive thru Coconut Grove everyday thru the Negro section, but otherwise no specific connection.\n",

My date, I remember, had long, dark brown hair. We passed one movie house playing El Cid I have not seen it and went to another one playing something like El Al. Solero. We decided to go to a different theater, however, because we did not like the looks of the movie much. The next thing I remember was something about a war on cigars by the Europeans. It seems that they liked being able to travel with lower air fares, but that they did not like cigar smokers on the planes. I guess I read this. Then I remember looking through a magazine and seeing an advertisement for a bicycle. To qualify, one had to take a test, which was sponsored by the Boy Scouts. They said to only write in if you thought you were 1. There would be more than one winner in NYC area and other cities. The last part of the dream involved a song by Ricky Nelson. In it, he was trying to get a girl who seemed to be his sister to leave a wild party gang. bang. I remember him singing. The singing and music were good and I thought that it would do well because it would appeal to all girls who wished they had an older brother to protect them. Then the song went on and Ricky, still singing, got involved in a fight with this girl's date. Ricky, however, seemed to be enjoying it and baiting the guy on. He was doing this as I woke up.\n",

      "15 I had a '49 Ford. It was blue. It was like a Ford that I had when I was in high school, and I did not have anything to do this night so I was just driving around. I went to a place that resembled the buildings around 12th Ave. and 13th St. These are the federal buildings where the jail is and stuff like that. I pulled over on a side street right off 12th Ave. at night, and I was just watching the traffic. I was real close to the Miami River bridge. I came back to the car and found a ticket on the windshield saying that I had parked crooked. When I parked there was no one there, so I did not know. So I parked at an angle, and did not know everyone was supposed to parallel park. I was the only car parked at an angle, but this ticket was not written on the regular form of type ticket paper. This was written, I had an old piece of paper laying on the seat, a piece of loose leaf paper, and the ticket was written out on that, and it said to report to a certain place in Coral Gables. I knew there was something wrong because you do not go to Coral Gables for a parking ticket, but I did not question, I was going to question the matter, so I was going to walk to the jail, to the courthouse where I was and ask them about it first. While I was walking, there was a bus in front of me, a Miami Transit Co. bus, and on this bus a little side door opened, like on the Greyhound bus where the baggage goes. Anyway, there was a side door on it. This Volkswagen 3 unit car. It was made out of all stainless steel or aluminum. It said Volkswagen on it, and it was like a little bus in itself. It had three units on it like three little cars. This thing drove right into the baggage compartment inside it, drove right inside the baggage compartment of the Miami Transit Co. bus. I remember that because it turned right in front of me to drive into the compartment. This is why the compartment was made, for this little other. There was a compartment on the big bug and it was made for this little Volkswagen bus which was about 3 feet high and about 15 feet long. So I saw this and I did not think much of it because I thought it was something natural and then I went to ask about my ticket. I got up to the steps. It was very confusing inside. They were just letting a whole bunch of prisoners go, and a bunch of bums were just walking outside. So I figured I would just forget about it and go over to the place where I was supposed to go. So I just walked back to my car and got in and drove away, which was the end of the dream.\n",

I feel better having it full now. I get in my red car with a floor stick shift and start to drive. I turn the corner to the left and squeal out, liking the good way the car is running. I feel pleased that I have three running cars now and Howard does not have as much. I feel a bit sorry for him, and as I drive I realize he wants to talk to me and wonder what it's about. I am feeling a bit superior about being better off than Howard. Then I remember I still live with my parents and feel embarrassed because I should at this age be out on my own. Even though I need someone to live in and help me, I could do that with a roommate. That would be more adult than relying on my parents.\n",

It's time to leave, and as I go down the stairs, I start to look and act a bit older 16 years or so and he is very enticed. I wear a sweater combo like in the 1950's. He follows. I run, laughing to my car and tell Lydia to hurry. We get in and he comes to the driver's side and wants to talk. I roll the window wet from rain down a quarter of the way. The window is a barrier for closeness and he asks me to open it more. I slowly, flirtatiously do so until it is full open. He wants to kiss me and I want it too, but hold off because of my tender age. I tell him I'm going to Judy's house to meet friends. He could go there too. We drive away, and I go to Judy's house, without Lydia now. I greet some girlfriends and soon he comes in and asks me to dance. I agree and we begin a slow dance. He bends down to kiss me and I turn shyly away. I'm too young yet. All right, he says, but do not let anyone else kiss you. Let me be the first. I promise and we dance more closely, hugging; we know we are made for each other.\n",

Grandma does too and then she gets up on the back of the curved couch to lay down, like a cat would, her feet hit the face of a man in the group, she scoots over to my side. I smile to see her like that. Then I say, It's after 200, can we leave pretty soon? She agrees and I start packing up my supplies, disks, pencils, papers, to take with me. I leave six pencils that might have been the church's property, hoping I do not take their stuff with mine. We drive off.\n",

Other objects are attached to it to make unusual music. I say to my friend, Look, He has a large mosquito tied to a string. It hums and he amplifies it when it's appropriate. Unique instruments. Later, my dancing friend and I are in a car. He's in the driver's seat and we're about to drive away. I'm in the passenger seat. I look out the window and see a two. story house with windows that roll down like car windows and most of them are open. I see two huge bears grizzlies starting to get out the windows.

A train can be seen in the distance. I suddenly remember that the noise of one train sometimes drowns out the noise of one coming from opposite direction, and such an occurrence now might get me run down, so I step off of track to watch the oncoming train. It proves to be a freight. First, there are a couple of box cars, then a small engine much like a switch engine; then a very big freight locomotive which I want to see more clearly. Opposite where I stand is a cut, and in some way this shuts off my view of lower portion of the big engine, and I am unable to see its drive wheels, which are what I am most interested in. First 3 or 4 cars beyond engines are flat cars filled with black men, evidently laborers. Rest of train is made up of flat cars loaded with wood . mostly stumps, logs, limbs, etc. . which apparently was picked up in some timber along the tracks. Some of the stumps show signs of having been trimmed before being loaded . i. e. , the roots are all cut off at about some length, and some of the roots evened up.\n",

I would not talk to him for the rest of the time and then fell asleep. I ended up getting really burned and when I woke up he was just staring at me and laughing. I asked him how he could just watch me get burned and he said that he thought it was a hilarious joke and that I was just messing around. Really irritated, I screamed, why would I burn myself for a joke? So he said, well come to think of it I guess that is pretty silly. I ordered him to take me home and said that I never want to talk to his dad again. Note the beach is really 40 min. from my house and I really like Steve's dad. We have a good relationship.\n",

We then all packed to go to the mountains. The snow was deep and I kept sinking but my aunt helped pull me out. That kind of scared me. We would slide down the hills and fly off over a jump. It was fun. In the distance we watch this big boat like thing run along the slope and people in orange, they looked like lifejackets, but I think they were chest guards because they would throw a lobster off the side and then do a belly flop onto the icy snow.

The ball is kicked and one of the girls on my team now everyone from my floor was participating the ball bounced and we did not know if we could run with it but I told her to pick it up and run and I tried to block a guy who looked like a hockey player but for some reason he got around me and made a tackle. The official however gave the ball to the other team because the camera did not pick up the play and he did not see what happened. I still have one shoe in my hand and I had tried to block by using the shoot because I did not have any of the shoulder pads so the opposing team looked pretty big. We changed directions on the field and it changed into a giant growing moss, comparable to a water bed and we did backward summersaults as the waves carried us down the field. When the other team have the ball I tried to go after the guy with the ball but he laid down and I did not know if he was trying to trick me or if I should take the ball from him.

      "I remember being at school when I decided I had to leave. I was then in my car driving when I see a crowd of student around a building. The sign said the MCC was close. This does not make sense because you cannot drive by the MCC so I figure I was not at my school. I see a friend and I pick her up. We start driving and that's where the dream ends. Another dream I remember is that I am in some room with a friend. I'm trying to explain something to her. She does not understand. No matter how simplified I tell her, she does not get it. I was really confused throughout my dreams.\n",

      "I do not have a lot of specifics for this dream. My boyfriend and I were going to go on a trip. We were packing and pretty excited. We were going to drive, but I'm not sure what our destination was. The image that stands out in my mind is my boyfriend's face. It's really big, like a floating cloud. He's very happy and has a big smile on his face. I can see each and every whisker on his chin. It felt surreal. Then I could not feel my feet touching the ground, but it was okay.\n",

      "This dream was simply bizarre. It started with me being at home but things were far from normal. My parents were is some musical event and needed a microphone so they sent me across the street to this crazy, carnival like shopping mall. All of this was happening at night with a full moon, clear starlight sky, yet apparent rain puddles everywhere. The shopping center was very bright, full of lights, color, toys, hardware, food, and lots of noise. It was surprisingly busy for this time of night and it was difficult trying to find what I was looking for. I needed a electronic shop yet every time I'd see one it would disappear or hide behind another shop. I could remember the detail on the microphone I was trying to find right down to the make, model, and serial number. Some may recall was pretty good. Suddenly my little brother shows up and tells me I'm looking in the wrong place and that he'll take care of it. I find myself home again only this time in my own room devoid of richer except for curtains and mini blinds on the window. There was a swing of some sort in my room so I go on it and began swinging, twirling, and floating around in circles. I hear people talking to me almost in rebuke but I did not care, it was like being a kid again. On the old swing when at the park where I'd grown up. Just feel and careless, however, I noticed outside that strange little people were coming down the block towards my house my house is at the corner where two neighborhood streets intersect I thought they were kids but they were definitely not because they were riding strange electric bikes and had on this armor over their top torso which was purple and dark blue. They had some sort of gun I've never seen before and they go in a fight with what looked like police or somebody chasing them. Suddenly I was outside with them and feeling fear and apprehension. The rest is rather bizarre and harder to follow but goes like this. I'm seen, of course, and they push me along with them to the end of the block. They do not speak at all but they look human except their faces are rather purpleish blue. I get the end of the street where there are tons of them with bikes, vans, cars, And lots of regular people all in a group watching them. Maybe they were there against their will or maybe just curiosity. I ran into my best friend Christine who seemed very worried telling me we got to get out of here, JR and Charles two of her guy friends are trying to get a car. I found this line funny since she tells me this every weekend when we want to get off campus and go somewhere close JR pulls up in a car and she gets in but I wait because I see them the strange people looking at this pregnant woman and the guy standing by her in a funny way. Instantaneously they're both gone. Now, scared I get in the car and we take off. We start going faster and faster but were being followed. It seems like we drive forever until we reach daylight. Were crossing this body of water and the water is practically coming onto the roadway. We are informed that it is the Mississippi River. How we got there from California I do not know. Thinking all is safe, we stopped to get something to eat only to find that they're right behind us. We starting running through shopping malls and finally across an intersection towards a building where we steal a car and take off.\n",

      "I remember bits and pieces from a dream I was having right before I woke up. I remember I was on some kind of journey or long walk. There were lots of people on either side of my path, but I did not talk to any of them, actually, maybe they did not talk to me. I felt kind of sad or lonely along the way and I think that is because the people were not talking to me. The path seemed long or the dream seemed long, but I do not remember why I was taking this walk. Right before I woke up I came to a tall brick wall. I remember I could not climb over or walk around it. Right when my alarm clock went off I was staring directly at the wall. It was so big and I was confused about what to do next. When I woke up I was still feeling confused. At first I could not remember why I was up so early. It took me a moment to realize I was supposed to record my dream. I am reading a book right now for class that is about a pilgrimage. The walk I was taking reminds me of the characters journey.\n",

We had no sleds, but we just started sliding down with pure joy. It was snowing. We laughed and laughed and ate the snow like we did when we were little kids. After our sledding adventure her mom picked us up and took us to this little caf in town where we sipped rosy cheeked on hot chocolate. It tasted so good and we could not stop laughing. I felt free from everything. The only emotion that I could describe was pure joy.\n",

      "I remember two dream fragments 1. I was talking with a friend who was telling me about how she was probably going to go to or transfer to Stanford University. Her name was Hal and there was supposed to be some connection to her name and the school, but all I could connect it to in the dream was that it was the name of the computer in Space Odyssey 2001. We me and another friend outside, facing towards Palo Alto, it was a bright, sunny Silicon Valley day. 2. My other fragment had to do with a party, I think I was throwing one. I remember I had cut out pictures from a magazine to symbolize the mood I wanted the party to take on  posh 40s50s style elegance but when I came back to get pictures they were stolen. It was evening outside. That dream somehow transferred to my parents and I standing inside our house looked like our house talking and hustling about. I was trying on my mom's clothes and trying to roll them and tie them because they were also my ex boyfriends clothes. The shirt was checkered and brown and I tied it at my waist and the pants were a lightweight purple cotton. I was wearing his boxers to. My mom had to rush to the hall and I was following her around as she got them together. She was kind of guarding me. I was talking yesterday with a friend about possibly transferring schools.\n",

We jumped on a moving car and then jumped off and ran into this deserted house that I remember going into before, and I tried to lift up one of the wooden boards that I thought would reveal a secret passage but didn't, so we lifted one further up, but we were caught, so we tried to run but there were so many fences. I ran up a balcony and while up there, one of our pursuers threw a brick at me, it missed, but then he began throwing rocks, which I then picked up and threw back at him.

Then the ones in this group told me and my friend that they were moving into an apartment soon.

I feel we are not fully prepared for the concert, but then I am not in the concert, but afterwards I see pictures of the choir members carrying my friend also in the choir above their heads during the first song, to add some excitement to the show. Then I see pictures of myself in the concert being lifted up and then diving from their hands to the couch. I totally laugh, wondering how they even got me to do that. I go to show my mom the pictures, but she has already seen them. In another dream, I am walking home to my house in southern California with my friend Charlotte. We are walking throughdown these hills and we get alongside the coast. We are standing at the top of these sandy cliffs and Charlotte, the avid hiker, is asking me if I want to take this special hike, named after some guy, down the cliff a long ways so that we can walk alongside the ocean. The other option is to walk along the cliffs, and I am scared of falling off and I would rather get to the seashore so that I will feel secure. We start going down the cliff, with many other people . it's some kind of tourist attraction. We are practically going straight down these cliffs, which are not solid sand at all, so I keep sinking my hands and feet in them, which I guess is supposed to support me, but I feel certain I will fall. There are also yellow and black cords around to sort of hold on to. When we reached the bottom, our other two friends are suddenly with us. We are looking for a restroom . there are many of them, but all the toilets are in a big room of this house. like place. We go to the bathroom and then climb back up the cliffs. So then we are on a street in a town and it is snowing, although the sand is part of the snow. I put on the hood of my gray SCU sweatshirt over my head and keep my umbrella over my head. I got this umbrella when I was going down the cliffs . we were supposed to have one so that sand from the people above us would not fall on us directly. Also, when my friends and I were at the restroomtourist house, I found a pin that said Ubi Caritas on it. And my friends asked what it means and I tell them Where true love and charity are found, God is there. This confuses my friend Kat.\n",

I had a physiology test I was studying for and so I was up all night studying for it in my car in a school parking lot. I got about one hour of sleep and then in the morning my friend Andrea woke me up by knocking on the car window. Then a bunch of people came over and jumped on my windshield and tried and did get into my car. I think they noticed that I had been sleeping and that I was pissed, so they got out. I drove away, thinking to get rid of them, to a different part of the parking lot. There was a gathering of people down one aisle of the lot but I turned down it anyway. They did not move. most were standing but a little girl was standing on the pavement with them, arms outstretched into the aisle. I drove by quickly because I was perturbed by the previous incident and tried to avoid the group in the aisle. I thought I did, but then I heard screaming and crying. I had run over the girl's hand. I got to her and could not stop apologizing, but then I noticed it was gushing blood. I applied pressure and bandaged it, but the finger had been deeply cut into. I felt overwhelming guilt. The others were glaring at me. We took her inside the school to get to a nursedoctor and they kept asking me how this happened, and I was crying, but the doctor assured me that it was an accident. I could not be calmed down. They took her to the hospital and I followed somehow we had to drive through a desert to get there. At first, it looked as though everyone would be okay, and the family was beginning to forgive me. The doctors thought the finger could just be sewed up. So I went home and was in my room. An hour or so later, two female doctors from Cowell arrived in my room and said there was bad news . the girl would have to lose the finger . she had no pulse in it. I was incredulous. I felt so terrible . here I am, an EMT, supposed to help patients but instead injuring someone and creating new patients. This all felt so real that I was sure it was true. I asked my mom if it could be a dream, but she said no because I had the gash on my forehead from when I had slammed on the breaks.\n",

I sit at the head table next to the groom's mother and across from his father. Across from me there is a black woman. First there is a needle sticking out of her skin. Then I feel a needle stick out of my skin as well. Something further sticks out under the eye. A kind of jack, of the game jacks. Then I take a jack out of my mouth. It is one with four sides. More and more jacks come out of my mouth. It is happening to the black woman as well. In the beginning the groom's parents are amused. But then they begin to find it awful. They say, Robbie, this is crazy, this is going too far. You cannot do this. This is ridiculous. Terrible. They get up. I run away from the table and go somewhere. I see the bride. She is upstairs. Now there are no longer jacks in my mouth. She is dressed beautifully. She is wearing a gown of old silk. It shines beautifully. It has a light ivory color. It also looks a little like taffetta. I bow to her and she laughs. She is surrounded by all of her bridesmaids. Then I find a map. A very ancient map. I am now someone else. A blond fellow student with a classical Latin surname, whose father had been an ambassador with a home on a Greek island. Ihe finds the map. There is a drawing in it. And the drawing has a square with an X inside, an onion. shaped dome on top. The whole picture reminds me of an hourglass. he walks with this drawing through many adventures. Many things happen that he has to get through. And in the end he comes back to the wedding with the scroll under his arm. he has been able to hold on to the scroll through all his trials and tribulations. But it is all over now. He is terribly ashamed for all the mess he has made there. The long tables are empty and the chairs lean against them. It is really a feeling of after. the. great. party, which has been missed entirely. Then he goes over to the river and sits on the grass. Suddenly he sees to his left, on the riverbank, a building. The building is exactly, but exactly, the drawing he has carried with him through all these trials and adventures. It reads on it in Dutch This is the designblueprint of the world. He looks at it and I stand next to him. He sees it and it is fantastic to behold. And then it immediately becomes very old. It disappears, entirely decayed, out of this world. It looks like the whole building is driving off; it goes away. I tell him I hvae enormous respect for you that you have done all this! Because it really was there. You held on to the image. Because you did it like you did, you've been able to hold on to the image. The image was really present. The building has truly existed. Nobody knows it but you. You've kept the image. You know it. And I do not believe that I'd have ever been able to do so. I already got scared when things went wrong at the table with the jacks in my mouth next to my parents. I already found that a terrifying experience. The building had been made of wood; old wood. It was a geometrical form. At first when it was new, it was very beautiful. And then it very quickly became old. Because it was all long, long ago. A certain game was played before the wedding. Someone went through a certain transformation all the time. Because suddenly I saw him sit somewhere as a dressed. up animal. Something to do with an elephant. The game had to do with the notion that everything had meaning and everything was meaningful to a ridiculous degree. I am amazed that he kept it all going. That he actually kept going so he would finally see the building. The Entwurf. It was like a mill where grain was pounded. Very ancient; very, very ancient.\n",

It's a night landscape. Pebbles on the ground. And I say, Oh, my God, I did not pick my video camera. And a woman I am walking with, one of the astronauts, says Oh, do not worry. See all those packages? There are a lot of packages standing there. They must have packed it somewhere. She says, Look, those are the only speakers! My God, they are so expensive. They are, I say. They must take a lot of abuse in outer space. We come to a place that is like an ongoing patio in this intermediate station on the moon. She says, as if she suddenly remembered something, Oh, come, I'll show you the place where it all started. She takes me by the hand and runs me over to a cave. We come in the cave and I somehow know what's going to happen. Somehow I know it. The transformation happens immediately. We are waltzing. And we're clearly in the nineteenth century. We've traveled back in time but I do not realize it at the moment. Although on the other hand I do know. She has late. nineteenth. century clothes and I wear tails. The room is large. Everybody around is waltzing. I say in broken German, Madam, I want to marry you. She answers in the same broken German with an English accent Yes, I also want to marry you. I know there is something strange. Then it is as if she is an actress; yet I know that we are in the nineteenth century. And suddenly everything changes. People at gas stations with dirty T. shirts and I remember the word Euro. pants floppy pants with suspenders. We're back in some kind of town in the twentieth century, somewhere in the American Midwest or Texas. It is a tremendous shock, though I know that it is happening. But still the transformation is a tremendous shock. This is a mission that is going on having to do with working on dreams. The mission is something like in the movie 2001 A Space Odyssey. I have to keep track of this!\n",

      "Adelaide 18. I am at an intersection. I take a left turn but have to go back and return. Then I am at a place en route to Boston. I take a left turn and there I come up to a crossing where each street is one way the wrong way, so I cannot continue. At my right there is a gray. haired woman, a depressed patient I saw in a mental hospital for a while. She is on a bicycle as I am trying to turn to go back. I bump into her slightly and she becomes completely hysterical the way she'd be on the ward. She shrieks, To think that you believed that you would get a Nobel Peace prize! I never thought that; you always said that, I reply. She is now my mother, very irritated. My reply shuts her up because it is true. But where do you have to go? I ask. We are on the side of the divided parkway where I'm traveling back home. I have to go to the bar mitzvah of Robbie she says. She means the other boy who was called Robbie in my childhood. I ask her where. She tells me. So maybe you can go straight, but it is a long, long bicycle ride, she says in an irritated voice, Just let me be! It sounds like my mother in the dream with my father's bon vivant brother, annoyed and martyrish. She becomes my depressed patient again. She is with a friend, an older woman who is trying to calm her down. I'm in the car with someone; it seems to be one of my children. The passenger asks, Is she crazy? I say, Yes.\n",

      "I dreamed my father, my roommate and myself went out to a lighthouse in Lake Erie. It was a sightseeing tour of the deepest part of the lake. Somehow, when it was time to submerge, the only person going down was me. I don't' think I was frightened, but I was a little nervous because the man who was to go with me was late. I can remember worrying that my hair was going to get wet and that I was having trouble wrapping a scarf around my head. Finally the man arrived and ordered me to get into the contraption which was like a diving bell. I can remember the opening was a little below the water and I had to hold my breath in order to get inside of it. It was very damp inside and there was water on the floor. We finally took off and I waved goodbye to daddy and my mother from the peep holes.\n",

It seemed that this expedition was part of a class requirement in which the majority were males. something at that. They were waiting for me and I was trying to get a fishing rod. I called to them to help me if they were in such a hurry, but they wouldn't, so I started picking out and untangling a line I found there in the sand, thinking to drop it in and hold it wound on a stick. They said it would be fine. Then my mother came and said it was so squally that she did not think she'd go and I thought about it and decided I would not either, so I told them to go ahead and leave. Then later someone came to my house and seemed quite distraught. The ship had gone down and she was grieving for her son. I had been in bed, but got up and began putting on my clothes to go and look for him. I had the feeling, however, that he was dead. I also felt glad that I had not gone on the trip. I also felt that his arm was off.\n",

The driver is A mentioned in earlier dreams. He keeps coming ahead and slowly pushes me and the cart back into the yard in a spirit of fun. He gets out of the car and I go to find him expecting to be greeted with some warmth, since we had not seen each other for a year, but he is not particularly affectionate. I decide that this is because of the other people around, particularly my mother. I mention to him that I had just sent him a letter since I was not expecting him home for several weeks yet and he just shrugs. There are several small children in the yard and we amuse ourselves by playing games with them.\n",

Four little boys were playing where my glasses had fallen off so I went back to pick them up. But the smallest boy had them and would not give them to me unless I gave him a dime. Then he dropped them and both frames and lenses broke. I could not drive without them so I was very angry and made him give me his name and address so I could send his mother the bill the name was Asa something!. I went home for my streetcar pass so I could go back and get the car. It was cold and night time and I was dead tired and my father could not drive me there because his car was broken. It was about dawn when I went outside. In front of our house was a car with a boy I know in it with his three roommates sleeping. I woke them up and the boy held out my car key to me. I do not know why this was so wonderful but I did not have to go back for my car. There was snow on the ground too.\n",

We had our family car at school but we were going to take the bus to Detroit as I usually do when I go home and we were to drive from there. We raced around making plans, buying bus tickets and checking schedules. Then we went down to the bus station and checked our suitcases through. The only trouble was that we did not know how to get the car from school to Detroit. All of a sudden I realized how silly we were and said we can drive all the way home. With relief we went down and claimed our baggage.\n",

      "I dreamed that for some reason I was confined in the big brown house behind our lot. I was free to come and go as I pleased within the house, but I could not leave. The interior of the house was beautifully done in pale marble. There were no separate rooms, but it was divided into separate compartments by walls which protruded from the side walls at various angles. Straw mats were on the floor, and the large, short, fat man who kept me from leaving was always watching me. A wonderful man the boy I am engaged to kept coming to see me very often and begging me to come away from the place with him. I wanted to very much, but the fat man would not let us. One morning a group of school children, about 7 years old, were being led by the fat man in a tour of the building. We followed them, hiding behind the marble walls until we managed to escape. It felt so wonderful to be outside in the sunshine again.\n",

The teacher I was to assist is in real life my assistant, f, 25, in a nursery school. I was very worried as to how I could work at both nursery schools in one day. I remember taking the children in for a swim. It was a lake off a sandy beach. Then this head teacher said we would take them for a nature hike in the woods. I remember I only had on tennis shoes and therefore could not go with them. I rationalized that I would stub my toes with these thin tennis shoes. Therefore I stayed to prepare art work for the children because I knew the head teacher was not capable of it. As I was doing my art work making balloons for them to color 2 or 3 girlfriends appeared and we began to play cards. In the midst, my mother. in. law called to ask if we were having fun. I knew she was really calling to see if her son my husband was home safely. Next, I was getting my coat to leave the nursery school and I met a girl I grew up with but have not seen in a few years. I introduced her to my husband and asked about her baby. She said it was a girl called Tonia.\n",

There were many members and prospective members sitting in the living room and dining room because it was so crowded. I called the meeting to order and then most of the members got up and said they were going on the front porch where they could hear the meeting from there. I was so ashamed and insulted because of the guests there, many whom I had personally invited that I put my coat on, asked one of the guests if she wanted a ride home and stormed out. Only my car had disappeared. I told my friend my age that it was probably stolen even though I had locked it. We waited a few minutes and soon a Negro woman drove by and parked my car. Seated in the back were four little colored boys. She got out and said to me, would you please drive these boys home? I told them all to get out and asked her how she got in. She said she forced open a window. I then got in and drove away with my friend.\n",

I took particular notice of various stores and other familiar landmarks along the way and got some feeling of satisfaction out of recognizing them.

Suddenly my father started driving faster, explaining that he had seen a man just drive his golf ball and he was afraid it might hit one of the windows in our car. The next thing I knew was that the ball had come through the rear window and it hit me on the collar bone, which immediately swelled up. Also much glass lodged in my neck. We started home so that I could be doctored. We had only gone a short distance when the bump on my collar bone disappeared and I seemed perfectly well. Then I came out of the house not my own home.

I was afraid the stranger who had my car would shoot me or run after me, but he did not. I yelled to the railroad man to get the license number of the car. He did, but as soon as the stranger drove away with the car, he changed the license plates so that the police could not locate my car. Finally seven years later I got my car back.\n",

One was a little marshmallow type trailer, the kind families tow behind little cars, and the other was the trailer from an 18. wheeler. There no windows or windshields and was puzzled as to how he was going to drive. Suddenly, we ended up at a very rocky cliff side, kind of like the edge of a waste dump. There was a waterfall that shot over the edge. Over time I guess the pressure of the waterfall had churned up the dirty brown water below and created a foam that sat on top. As we moved closer to the waterfall I kept getting hit with foam. I think we were trying to get behind the waterfall to hide. I kept getting water in my bag and then suddenly noticed that policemen were climbing next to me. We spoke briefly but I do not remember what was said.

I was standing by my car. putting sunscreen on. A family friend named Sally C. came up and said hi with her daughter. we caught up for awhile. It was really fun to talk with her. Later all my friends started showing up with their parents, sitting at tables on the water. My brother, my dad and I were all dressed pretty preppy and the table of guys next to us wanted to guess where we were from. Finally we told him Idaho, but he got it confused with Iowa. A group of girls had to move tables toward the light. next to our table. when it got dark.\n",

      "I was inside a building that was my Junior year. Casa Italiana dormsuite. All my roommates were there except one Emily, Trisha, and Anne. but not Isabelle. I felt glad Isabelle was not there. but wondered why Trisha and Anne were still around. I was leaving the dorm, ready to go home for the summer, but then the 'scene' changed. I was in a parking garage and kept calling one of my old friends from high school. Kimberly. She was driving around in a VW. like car in the parking garage. I kept punching in her  in my cell phone and calling her. She was supposed to meet me in the parking garage and pick me up. I was irritated that she was not there and sad because I assumed she did not want to hang out. Suddenly, I was at my house in Stockton and Kimberly called me. She said she was sorry. she was trying to call me. but her phone was not working. The 'scene' shifted again and I was excited about starting SCU for senior year and looking forward to living in the dorms with friends. Kimberly said she wanted me to live in her suite at SCU. I remember thinking it was weird that the suite and SCU were just down the street from my house. about a block a way in a white building that actually belongs to UOP which is just down the street from my house. I was puzzled, but still wanted to move in. For some reason I slept outside in a sleeping bag in front of the building in anticipation of moving in. when I woke up I could not wait to see Kimberly and my last year roommate Emily. but both were not here. I was shocked and upset to see that my ex. friend and roommate Trisha also been sleeping in front of the building. I was so disgusted that she was there and confronted her. She said she and Anne were going to room with me again bc there was no other suite open. I was frustrated and upset, but thought I would not have to interact with them even if they lined in my suite. Then Kimberly and Emily showed up and Kimberly decided to take us on a tour of the dorm. She lead and everyone followed her across the lawn into the white building opened up into a huge grassy courtyard with many other white building bc that is not how the building looks from the outside. We walked across the grassy courtyard and came to a building that had a very highlong staircase. We climbed them and I though that it was a lot of energy and trouble to get to the suite. We passed a dining hall on the right, made a left, and walked around an outdoor hall covered by an overhang. We were all at the door to the suite and I wanted to see the room.\n",

In the drive there, my dad scenes to be driving sporadically and dangerously. He swerves at a fast pace throughout other vehicles. I am in the backseat, but I can see that the sky is a beautiful orange tint as the sun is just going down. When we arrive, I suddenly realize I have a broomstick with the ability to fly. I kick up off the ground, but hand on for dear life as I'm not used to the speed. I literally felt my heart pounding as I struggled to climb back up. When I regained balance, I pushed the broomstick to fly further down the coast and toward the sunset. I felt the wind fly my hair around it was truly exhilarating. I turned around when I realized how far out in the ocean I was. I flew close to share and saw my mom and 2 brothers on the bottom floor of a hotel with glass walls, but no sign of dad. I suddenly kicked away and flew inland. From there it was like I merely watched 'my dream. self' fly from the middle of the desert, which was hot and had little greenery, down the highway about a hundred feet above cars.

We were playing with Macey on the street but had to stay close to her because cars would drive by and we did not want her to get hit. The street outside my house that we were on curves around, and parallel to the street as it goes straight, is a creek. After a car drove by, we somehow knew that it was the last car driving by so we let Macey go and had her run to us. She ran super super fast and I was worried because she was going so fast and not turning to continue on the street. Instead, she ran into the creek, which was extremely deep. It scared me seeing Macey hit the ground. Suddenly, Macey was clinging to her right front and back legs separately. Kathy then came over and saw Macey stretching out her legs, though we knew they were broken. I looked to see if the bones were shifted and the legs looked different. They were not.

My favorite aunt  uncle in Detroit MI had won the 'big' lottery. They surprised all of my family members by paying off all of our debts. This was a big relief for the family members. It gave each of them an opportunity to splurge on some personal things that they desired but could not afford due to the bills they had accumulated. My Mother was so excited that she broke down in tears of joy. My sister and I were delighted and full of giggles as they paid off all of our college loans.

I was having a difficult time with the choices 1 stay home after high school and work with my father to learn his trade and take over the business or 2 do something that will take me out of the valley and allow me the freedom to experience adventure everyday. That option being joining the military. In doing so I thought I would be an aviationjet propulsion mechanic and travel with the military abroad and work hands on whether out in the field or stationed at a base. I felt this was the ultimate dream to accomplish and I would push for this so that I could get away from the same old same old stuff here in my agricultural valley. I continued to have this dream for approximately 2. 3 years. Well I finally graduated from high school and took off out. of. state to live with my brother because he joined the Navy and is being educated in Nuclear engineering in Charleston SC. Lived with him for 6 months and tried to enlist only to get ignored overlooked and lied to. I have now been told that my medical history has an area which needs medical attention requiring my parents to fork out lotsa money to pursue their request and since my parents do not have any medical insurance I made the very serious decision of just ending or realizing the dream of adventure with the military due to this burdensome request. I am now working with my Father and being trained in his hydraulic trade. I will be attending local community college to also add a little flair to the business by taking business classes so I can also be well versed on conducting business and knowing the financial side of it. The dream I have had for several years was quashed but in the end I am very happy. My employer is my Father someone who has loved cared nurtured advised mentored me and wants what is best for me. What more of an adventure could I experience when it was right in my own home all along.\n",

I gained flight and flew to my city's downtown district where amongst the usual tall buildings there was Big Ben in the middle probably a result of watching 101 Dalmations. I flew past the grand clock and over the Atlantic Ocean evidently on route to some place in Europe. I landed at an American. looking amusement park similar to Six Flags where my mother was nearby.

By the time you are up at the top of the mountain, you have ran out of trees and among the cliffs. The rocks are a beige in color, and as you curve around a bend, you find a cave opening. If you continue around the bend, there is another way up to the top of the mountain, but this is more steep and treacherous. The difference is the lack of trees on that route. Once inside the cave, you find that there are multiple crevices which peer outside to the path that you came on. The cave meanders around deeper into the ground, and as you follow the path, it gets increasingly dark. There is a door of some sort, which leads to a deeper, wetter, darker cavern. As you are explore this area, you have the feeling that you are being watched, and that there is something else in the cave with you. You decide that you are done exploring, based on this, and proceed to leave. You take the path back down the canyon, but as darkness approaches, you camp at the campground halfway down. As you are there, you see plenty of others also there, but you still have the feeling that what was in the cavern, has followed you here. You hear some commotion from some of the other camps and decide to take off. You start running down the path in the dark, as you feel something following. About this time you wake up. This dream recurs often, and I always find various new ways to the cavern, but the path around it always is the same.\n",

      "The time in which I had the dream was sometime in the mid to late 80's and I was around 25 years old. I was married with two small children and I had just found out that my husband had cheated on me. Being from the south and raised in the Bible Belt, my faith has always been the stability of my life. When I found out about his infidelity I packed up my things and my kids and went to my mom's many miles away. I was visibly shaken and upset so she suggested that I call the pastor of her church to maybe talk it over. I reluctantly gave him a call and as we spoke he suggested that I go for a walk and just talk to God as if I could see Him walking right beside me. I did this and spoke aloud to God about my feelings over the situation. That night as I went to bed I had the dream. I remember standing in front of a huge grayish color cloud and sensed a Presence behind the cloud. I knew that it was God and that He was behind the cloud to protect me from seeing His face. It seems I could remember a passage in the Bible that says no man can look upon the face of God and live. In the dream I was pouring out my heart to God about my heartbreak and disappointment over my husbands cheating. I cannot recall everything that I said to God but I remember very specifically that He always gave me two answers to every question and concern that had. The first answer was one that satisfied my concerns, and the second was always the same for every question, He simply said Trust in Me. During the time I stood before Him, I never felt rushed, He was patient and kind and loving. He listened to my every concern until I was satisfied with His answers. When I awoke the next day I did not immediately remember the dream. My husband came to my moms and made an attempt to reconcile. I decided to take him back and to try again. On the way home we were in two different cars and as I was driving along the dream vividly came back to me. I stopped the car and told my husband the dream. We worked things out for a little while but things turned sour again and after 20 years of marriage, we divorced. I know that God was my strength and my answer to the problems in my marriage. He brought me through much heartache and pain. He was with me during the difficulty of the divorce and has lifted me above the obstacles in my life to help me be a self. supported woman, independent and strong to this day. Im told that most people cannot remember dreams as vividly as I do. Ive always considered it a gift from God because Ive had them since I was very young and most of my dreams have meaning behind them. I keep a journal and log the dreams into it so that I can pass them to my children ad grandchildren some day.\n",

We came to a fictional town that I felt in the dream was amazingly nostolgiac. We'd come there many times in my youth to visit a relative and a particular park, neither of which actually exist. We parked and visited the house we used to go to, even though the relative was dead now. I had intense feelings of peace and happy childhood days. After that, we drove to the park which faced out into Lake Huron and was very hilly and forested. We were driving around looking for a place to park, and I could not wait to show my kids around a place that I'd loved as a child. I woke up before we found a place to park.

It was always a white car, and I was always traveling fairly slowly, but pressing on the brakes hard and just could not get the car to stop. I believe there were a variety of scenerios, but one in particular stuck with me, even now . forty years later. I was leaving a white farm house, which sat at the top of a great sloping hill with a long drive way which meandered through the front acreage. There was a wood fence or gate which the driveway passed through, which separated the yard area of the house and a front pasture area with a small stream flowing across the foot of the slope. I was pulling through the wooden gate in a white car, of course and touched the brakes to slow a little before starting down the hill. but there was nothing there in the brake pedal. The dream ended there, with me sitting on top of that hill with no brakes. In other versions of this dream, I spend a bit of time pressing desparately on the brakes trying to get the car to stop before I wake up . to no avail. Only that one dream took place on the top of the hill, however. The odd thing was, when I was in my mid. twenties, my husband bought a white car which always seemed to have 'iffy' brakes. Naturally, I was never comfortable driving that car. And I've never had the 'no. brakes' dream again.\n",

Im not sure where i was going but i was trying to drive from the back seat. I had this dream 3 months ago it ended with me driving. My alarm woke me.\n",

      "A few weeks ago I discovered I had some worn out parts on my mustang. I was waiting until I got paid to repair the parts. A few days before I made the repairs I had a dream. I dreamed I was driving to work on a two lane country highway which is my actual route and I was getting close to a bridge that crosses a river. As I got closer to the bridge the front end of my car gave way, and my car started to flip over towards the guard rail. My car went over the bridge into the water. I woke up as the car filled with water.\n",

I am looking around in the stores at different kinds of make up and clothes. All of sudden people come in and start setting everything on fire and hitting people when they try to run away. For a minute I feel extreme fear and anxiety until I realize in the dream that I am dreaming. Knowing this I'm suddenly not afraid of the people setting fire to the place and hurting everyone, I simply find an escape route quite easily and leave.\n",

For some reason it appeared the event had stringent restraints on it due to legislation passed by our North American Unified totalitarian government apparently the government body of all of North America. It became obvious to me i was dreaming when a political activist began protesting at the event. The police burst into room and began arresting the bulk of the group, and was able to envision a doorway out of the room, which led to an unfolding escape route, where i made my way home in a blurry, long drawn out dash through familiar edmonton city streets. The event as i gathered from the streets i traversed, took place downtown.\n",

All the treatments that i was goign to have to go through were very painful looking and I started to get very scared. All that I wanted to do was run away from everyone.

I realized, within the dream that I was trying to do this and meeting resistance because my fellow students did not play Warcraft. Thereafter I was determined to help them start to play the game so that they could do quests. I set out to Future Shop to get them copies of the game but could not remember how many I needed. I recall driving past MacEwan and admiring the new Health building, whereupon I awoke.\n",

The teacher told me to choose one but i ended up with 5 bags of little toys and when I went to exit the room I was suddenly outside in the snow. Not even close to the school anymore. This is when I realized it was all a dream and still in my dream I noticed my grandma driving by and I asked her to drive me back to school. Aware that I was still in my dream I purposely gave correct directions back to the school. Usually in dreams I would end up anywhere, possibly giving made up directions to a new location.\n"
